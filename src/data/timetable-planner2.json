It considers civilization as an actor category. It explores how different conceptualizations of civilization have shaped India, and how India has shaped the concept of civilization.&nbsp;We will focus mainly but not exclusively on British/Western colonialists and thinkers on one hand and South Asian intellectuals on the other to embark on a journey that will begin from the middle of the eighteenth century and go right up to the present. The course will give students a fresh perspective on and a critical re-introduction to Indian history, how historical knowledge (including the kind of history that is taught in schools) is produced, and the many consequences of such knowledge in the making of our past, present, and future.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The following themes will be covered in the course (Note: this is subject to change on the instructors&#39; discretion).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 1</p>\n\n<p>1.

How far back in time do we have to travel in order to discover it? Starting from the dawn of history and taking a long view of the past, how can we make sense of the seemingly endless detail, the bewildering variety and uneven textures, the striking continuities shot through by even more striking changes? Does civilization reveal itself in the everyday rhythms of life of village folk, city dwellers or forest tribes? Is it represented in artefacts or ideas, in simple objects or grand monuments, in folk songs or classical literature? This course answers such questions by looking at Indian civilization through the coexistence of contradictions. We will see the coexistence of unequal societies with promises of salvation for all; of social prudery with a celebration of sexuality; of misogyny with the worship of goddesses; of religions preaching nonviolence with a politics marked by war and violence; of religious dialogue with religious conflict; of an inward-lookingness despite centuries of lively interactions with the world. By exploring such contradictions, the course will show that the past is neither dead nor dull, and that we need to understand it in order to understand our present and ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>(See attached file for details of topics)</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will understand how to analyze the complexities and contradictions that mark Indian history and culture over the centuries.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see attached file for themes and readings for this course.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The following percentages constitute your final grade:</p>\n\n<p>Class participation and DS discussion of readings: 25%; Mid-semester group presentation: 25%; Written Quiz/es: 50%</p>\n\n<p>Students are required to pass in all three of these segments in order to pass this course.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attending lectures and DSes is mandatory.

Are we always aware of and correct about our own emotions? Can we ever know or feel others&rsquo; emotions?&nbsp; Focusing on ten basic emotions: anger, humour, disgust, fear, envy, sadness, love, wonder, fun and boredom this course will explore the following four questions about emotions, their bodily expressions and their relationship to the ego (which need not be equated with) the self:</p>\n\n<p>1. Are emotions primarily a matter of the body, the brain, the nervous system, or the self&rsquo;s subjective consciousness, or are they constructed out of facial expressions, interpersonal interactions and moral evaluations thereof?</p>\n\n<p>2.

What this course seeks to explore is why the study of literature needs &lsquo;theory&rsquo; in all its various guises. What kind of relation does literature have with theory that is manifestly different, and indeed incompatible with, the traditional understanding of object and knowledge in philosophy and the sciences? The advent of &lsquo;theory&rsquo; (as contrasted with &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; and &lsquo;science&rsquo;) has to be seen, not just as the beginning of a radical critique of the purportedly self-evident notions of subject, class, caste, race, gender and identity but also as a revolution in the very concepts of knowledge, truth and reality themselves. What happens to these concepts when literature (which has for so long been the catch-all term for illusion, falsity, imitation and error) becomes the site of truth; when theory replaces philosophy?</p>\n\n<p>This course seeks to enter into these questions raised by literary theory. We will read texts by major theorists to see how theory displaces traditional philosophy and necessitates a practice that may be artistic, political, ethical or a combination of all three.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Objectives:</p>\n\n<p>To understand the importance of literary theory for literary studies.</p>\n\n<p>To be able to write and think about theoretical texts.</p>\n\n<p>To introduce students to the basics and make them understand the strengths and weaknesses of various theoretical approaches.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Presentations: 2 oral presentations in groups of 2 during the semester, one before the midterm break and one after.

When studying literature, we often seek out ways of uncovering the workings&nbsp; of these engagements in the texts we read. This course turns to the questions and answers posed by theory itself, rather than applications through the reading of literary texts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Theory can seem complex and intimidating, but its questions are fundamental: how do we make meaning? How do we constitute texts, and how do texts constitute us? How are we to know those parts of ourselves that refuse knowledge? How do our bodies, our given identities, and the material conditions of our lives shape who we are and how we feel, think, act, desire, and read? Keeping these and other basic questions in mind, this course will survey the key approaches and texts of contemporary literary theory.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1.

Even though its antecedents stretch as far back as Plato, we will be focusing on several schools of theory that begin in the early twentieth&nbsp;century: structuralism, deconstruction, psychoanalysis, feminism, marxism, historicism, ecocriticism, critical race and caste theory. The premise in all these theories is that literature is not a transparent medium that simply expresses the genius of its authors; rather, we need to work hard to expose&nbsp;to&nbsp;critical scrutiny the often unvoiced assumptions of our &quot;common sense&quot; so we can begin understanding how writers and readers -- meaning we ourselves -- are entangled in larger, dynamic structures of language, society, and planet that make us &quot;us.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

However, long before its rise to global power with the East India Company, Britain was a multicultural and multilingual zone. It was settled by Celts, conquered by Latin-speaking Romans in the first century CE, by Anglo-Frisian-speaking Germanic tribes in the fifth century, by Scandinavian-speaking Danes in the 8th century, and by French-speaking Normans in 1066. And these peoples traveled, in imagination and reality, to Europe, Africa, the Levant, and India.</p>\n\n<p>The early literature of the place that became Great Britain, hence, reflects a wide range of cross-cultural exchanges&mdash;with Britain&rsquo;s neighbor and conqueror France, with the peoples of Scandinavia, with Italy, with the Middle East and Asia, as well as with many imagined &lsquo;others.&rsquo; The literary responses and reconfigurations of these exchanges will be the focus of our survey of early British literature this semester.</p>\n\n<p>This course will explore how the cultural encounters that took place in what we now think of as Britain are reflected and refashioned in literature. Attending both to Britain&rsquo;s multilingual and multicultural heritage and to the ways in which writers fashioned the idea of &ldquo;Britain&rdquo; in relation to its cultural, religious, linguistic, and gendered &lsquo;others&rsquo; will offer us insights into medieval and early modern understandings of language, identity, gender, race, religion, nation, and empire. Our inquiries in this course will offer insights not only into the workings of pre-modern literature but also into our own contemporary moment, in India and in the larger world.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>In this course you will:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>-acquire a deeper knowledge of the history of English literature and language with an emphasis on the cultural encounters that shaped that history;</p>\n\n<p>-become better readers of fiction as refracting complex social and historical realities, such as identity, multiculturalism, multilingualism, race, religion, gender, and conquest;</p>\n\n<p>-recognize how literature, even as it reflects its historical moment, also actively shapes and reimagines culture;</p>\n\n<p>-strengthen your close-reading skills. That is, enhance your ability to gain broader insights about a text by beginning with close attention to the particularities of language;</p>\n\n<p>-develop your academic writing skills.</p>\n</div></div>",

While some of these books are more academic in nature, others fall in the more conventional &ldquo;non-fiction&rdquo; narrative category. I have referenced some parts from some of the academic books in the readings list below. But the interested students would benefit from seeking out these books and reading them in their entirety.

The list is deliberately long, so that each student can read up more on the specific topic that she or he finds interesting. Before each class however I will assign a specific text from the list that the students should read up. The discussion during the class will refer to the material in that text.</p>\n\n<p>|| BASIC CONCEPTS ||</p>\n\n<p>Week 1: Introduction: Development, Poverty and Measurement</p>\n\n<p>Deaton, A.

The first part of the course is organized around the sequence scholars conventionally follow to conduct qualitative research: find a research question, engage with existing literature, formulate hypotheses, collect material, analyze it and effectively communicate findings. The second part of the course will familiarize students with various qualitative research methods and tools, including interviews, participant observation, case studies, and archival research using primary sources. In the process, students will reflect on (a) the ethics of conducting qualitative research and (b) the types of research questions to which such techniques are best suited. In the final part of the course, students will develop (and present) a research plan to collect data on their chosen topic using any one combination of methodologies from the following options:</p>\n\n<p>1. Participant Observation and Interviewing OR (developing interview questions, identifying a diverse portfolio of interviewees, identifying the biases/ positionally of people you are interviewing) 2. Thick description/ case study and archival research (what you find, what is missing, the positionally of the people who wrote the material)<br />\nBased on this data collection, students will write a final paper that formulates a research question, relevant hypotheses, and initial findings.</p>\n</div></div>",

Viewing through the lens of mathematical formalism, one would learn to appreciate the art of modelling instances, the elegance of logical reasoning, and to gauge the role of randomness and chance in the events occurring around us. This course will enable students to sharpen their mind with the power of creative thinking and open doors to an enchanting playground where by solving puzzles and quizzes, they would know how to unearth the underlying abstractions and apply them for solving real-world problems, regardless of their prior knowledge of mathematics. The clever tricks of geometry and Boolean algebra, fascinating insights from graph theory, the beauty in algorithms, and the probabilistic approach to foreseeing an event, would boost up their confidence and proficiency. The vast repertoire of mathematical techniques blended with creativity and rigor will not only change their perspectives towards problem-solving but also provide them boundless opportunities to explore many uncharted territories such as law, finance, healthcare, and social sciences, by reducing challenges therein, to bare essentials. At the end of the course, students are likely to experience the joy of understanding complex problems with precision and clarity while fostering a sense of wonder and discovery. Having laid strong pillars on mathematical fundamentals and empowered with the subtle art of reasoning, they would naturally evolve as leaders in their respective professional frontiers.</p>\n\n<p>During the course we will walk through a selection from the following topics:</p>\n\n<p>1. Puzzles and paradoxes through patterns and numbers; fallacies in perception; coin-rotation&nbsp;paradox, the mystery of rotating gears; sequences; the art of modelling and judgement;</p>\n\n<p>2.

Defined in this way, the term is not reducible to any single genre, and examples range from the &ldquo;high-&ldquo; to &ldquo;lowbrow.&rdquo; If we understand &quot;cli-fi&quot; as being a literary and cinematic response to the scientific consensus that human activity is warming the planet, then it is a phenomenon of the late 20th and 21st centuries. In this course, however, we will be taking a broader historical approach. For one thing, the history of climate science is almost as old as the fossil fuel economy itself: Svante Arrhenius first described the greenhouse effect in 1896, and he was building on science that goes back at least to the 1850s. But more significantly, pegging climate fiction to atmospheric science implicitly posits a one-way street between scientific discourse and literary production, an assumption that is, put bluntly, wrong. In this course, therefore, we will read not only relatively recent literary texts that dramatize the climate crisis as we understand it today, but also more historical texts that think about the atmosphere both as a geophysical phenomenon as well as an aesthetic one. The course will include literature, theory, and film, with writers and directors ranging from H.G. Wells and Thomas Mann to Alexis Wright, Margaret Atwood, Bong Joon-ho, and Amitav Ghosh. In addition to the big question of representing something as dynamic as the atmospheric system, we will take up related problems such as deep time, the limits of realism and the possibilities of speculative&nbsp;fiction, and questions of environmental justice and ethics.</p>\n</div></div>",

The comparative method is a way of examining such phenomena. The subfield itself is broad and encompasses a variety of pertinent questions. In this introduction, we will focus on the thematic question: How does regime type affect policy outcomes? As a first cut, we will explore the selectorate theory. We will use its logic to demonstrate how democracies can have policy outcomes that are systemically distinct from their autocratic counterparts. Next, we will explore the economic and cultural determinants of democracy and study how transitions to democracy can occur. In the third part of the course, we will emphasize institutional variations within democracies and identify their consequences. For the last part of the course, we will re-examine the policy consequences of regime type. Is it merely a dichotomy; namely that &ldquo;democracy is good&rdquo; and &ldquo;autocracy is bad&rdquo;?</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Through the substantive portion of this course, students will 1) identify the major issue-areas in comparative politics, 2) define and demarcate major concepts in comparative politics, and 3) explain the policy predilections of different regime types. Through an emphasis on social scientific methodology, students will 1) understand the importance of methods in political science, and 2) learn about the use of appropriate theories to explain political phenomena.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>W.

With a central question &laquo; what can art practice tell us about social and political institutions and relationships? &raquo; this course explores the deeply fraught yet critical alliance between political practice and the art world. To address this issue, the course begins with answering why, in the first place, should social scientists be concerned about the arts?

The details of each are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Midterm essay: This short essay-plan will be written as a road map for a question framed by students themselves, drawn from the assigned themes and texts. This should include: what the research question is, how you plan to answer it and what is the value of asking this question. The plan should include a hypothesis, a short literature review and a working bibliography. The length of this assignment is 1500 words. Please avoid late submissions, and extensions will be granted only in documented cases of illness or family emergency. The essay is worth 20% of the final grade. Date of submission: 5th&nbsp;October 2024</p>\n\n<p>Final examination:&nbsp;&nbsp;The final examination will be a take home essay, on questions framed by students. The length of the essay is 3000 words. This is an exercise in writing and research, and it helps to spend an entire semester working on this one paper. Given that the deadline of the submission for the two essays in mentioned in the syllabus already, which is shared with you in the first week of classes itself, please avoid asking for extensions on the deadline.

The syllabus is designed to familiarize the students with select concepts and ethnographies of the discipline. We will discuss the sociology and anthropology of kinship, social stratification (caste, race, tribe), cities, migration, nationalism, and environment. Rather than treating these as independent concepts, we seek to show their inter-relation with other social phenomena. For example, how are notions of family and kinship intertwined with science and technology studies; what is the connection between migration and urban transformations, how does one critically study the relation between environment and tourism etc. By doing this, the course demonstrates how the sociological approach explores and finds relations and connections between people, places, and objects. The objective of this course is to develop students&rsquo; appreciation of concepts and categories and their evolution and innovation. This course will also demonstrate to students how theory, ethnography and critical thinking can be integrated. Course materials will include examples from India as well as other parts of the world, and will offer a representative overview and not exhaustive coverage of all topics and perspectives existing in the discipline.

As anthropologists have found to their chagrin, the more one tries to define the state, the more it eludes understanding. So how does one study the state ethnographically? For a long time, anthropologists who were conventionally concerned with non-Western societies, thought that some so-called simple societies lacked a political structure that one can term a state. Societies that did not have a centralised authority and administrative machinery were called &ldquo;state-less&rdquo; societies in the anthropological literature. But are power and authority only vested in states? Nowadays, stateless has a different connotation altogether, especially when we think of stateless peoples or refugees. The result is a confusing array of concepts and discussions around the idea of the state. How do sociologists and anthropologists begin to unravel this complex puzzle? How do we understand the relationship between state, power, and nation? How do we deal with questions of citizenship, nationalism, and bureaucracy? How have issues of borders, security, violence, and resistance become tied up with the idea of the state? This course will focus on the state as an object of sociological and anthropological inquiry. Rather than looking at the state as a monolithic entity, it will use various ethnographic examples to break down and expand the notion of state and understand the latter in its everyday workings and in its compromised realities.</p>\n</div></div>",

We will start by understanding how single neurons can perform computations and can be understand in the same framework as electronic circuitry. We will understand then how complex information processing and calculation can happen as a result of the ways in which multiple neurons signal to and connect to one another. We will then look at how the brain is organized, and study the nervous systems of humans and other animals, approaching this through the lens of the various tools that neuroscientists have historically used to study neuronal connectivity and the brain. We will cover the electrical properties of nerve cells and voltage dependent membrane permeability; channels, transporters, neurotransmitters and their receptors; synaptic transmission; the brain and its development and plasticity. We will also study complex brain functions and the neural basis of complex cognition, learning and information processing. We explore the ways in which the neuronal processes underlying behaviour have been deduced from various animal models of behaviour, and ways in which genetics and the environment shape the systems that produce behaviour during development. We will explore sensory perception and motor movement in depth.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This course is offered to both biology and psychology students and covers the same ground as a standard course on Biological Psychology. It aims to introduce neuroscience as a specialized discipline, and to enable students to understand how a biological system is able to signal information, perform computations and produce behaviour. This course will also use teaching tools in the discussion section that enable an intuitive grasp of neural processes, such as simulations to understand how various factors affect neuronal functioning, and experiments to demonstrate neurons in action and how various interventions affect neuronal functioning.</p>\n\n<p>In order to equip students to become familiar with the level of rigour needed to think through some of these questions, we will also look at how to survey and evaluate literature in the field of biological psychology, how to quickly but accurately read graphs and how to cite literature.</p>\n\n<p>We then turn to the question of how we learn, how we absorb new material, the ways in which our neural systems tend to conflate correlation and causation, and how critical thinking and environmental training can change learning patterns and feedback to change the structure of the brain. We will take a quick look at the neural basis of complex and interesting phenomena such as motivation, emotion, cognition, consciousness, attention. We will end with an exploration of how neural systems can exhibit pathology, how neurodegeneration and trauma can impact the system, and how medication and drugs work, with a focus on the limitations of what we collectively understand and the pressing need for further research to take forward the field. This course eventually hopes to make clear the relationship between brain and behaviour.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The recommended textbook for this course is Biological Psychology by James W. Kalat (Kalat, J. W. (2008). Biological Psychology. Calif: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning). I have a physical copy of the 11th edition. A soft copy of the 10th edition is also available on Canvas - the 10th and 11th editions do not differ hugely and I&rsquo;d recommend this for anyone who is comfortable with reading on their computers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For additional reading students can refer to:</p>\n\n<p>Kandel, E. R., Schwartz, J. H., &amp; Jessell, T. M. (2000). Principles of neural science. New York: McGraw-Hill, Health Professions Division.</p>\n\n<p>Purves, D., Augustine, G., Fitzpatrick, D., Hall, W., Lamantia, A.-S., &amp; White, L. (2012) Neuroscience. Sinauer Associates, Inc.: Sunderland, MA.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This class will have fourteen weekly quizzes, all open book. The idea behind this is to keep providing conceptual testing to enable you to check the soundness with which you have understood the material. There will be no testing requiring rote learning or simply checking familiarity with information. The best 9 out of 14 will count towards 90% of your final grade.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your participation in class or even by email or Canvas will count towards the remaining 10%. In terms of class participation, questions in class will be counted, as will engaging on Canvas, by email, etc. Your attendance counts as part of your participation grade: 5% of your total grade is class attendance and 2% is DS attendance.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The quizzes will be administered by Canvas. This requires a laptop or phone in class. The quizzes will be administered at the beginning of the Thursday class, and should take 25 minutes. The quizzes will be autograded and returned with the answer scheme by the following Tuesday at the latest, for immediate feedback.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For Graduate students (MA/PhD), the only difference between this course as offered for undergraduate and graduate students is that the assignment is mandatory for graduate students, and it counts for 30% of the final grade (and accordingly, only the best 6 quizzes count towards the final grade).</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Your attendance counts as part of your participation grade: 5% of your total grade is class attendance and 2% is DS attendance.&nbsp;Attendance: will be marked as a component of the participation grade, but not as a barrier to doing exams, etc. Missing class is a student&rsquo;s loss and will impact the class participation grades. For students who miss class for unavoidable reasons, they can visit the TA, during office hours for help. All those who are unable to attend classes due to medical reasons are requested to email the TAs&nbsp; (and cc&#39;d to the TFs, but please not to Bittu!), with a copy of their medical note or prescription (with the date clearly mentioned) along with their emails.</p>\n</div></div>",

We specifically focus on the centrality of visual archives in mapping histories of European colonialism under Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French, and British empires. The course will address a range of colonial formations and diverse articulations of nationalist thought and consciousness in different parts of the world through different visual forms across a range of media, sites, and objects. Beginning from naturalist paintings and drawings of unknown landscapes and oceans, descriptions of plants and animals, of unknown humans and exotic objects, the course moves on to explore diverse media and technologies of visual (re)productions like water colour, oil painting, lithographs, oleographs, chromolithographs, aquatints, photographs and the moving image, and maps different sites of visual simulations like cabinet de curiosities, &lsquo;freak shows&rsquo;, world exhibitions, metropolitan, colonial, and postcolonial public museums, art galleries, institutes of fine arts, crafts and design pedagogy. The course argues that global histories of colonialism, nationalism, and decolonization can be partially explored as histories of encounters, violent conflicts, tortuous negotiations, and often uneasy accommodations played out at the register of the visual image. The course urges us to rethink that the notions of metropolis and colony, empire and nation, colonizer and colonized, alien and indigenous, as they are configured and reconfigured in the archives of the visual image, are historically relative, often fluid categories, having only situational relevance. Moving away from a purely Euro-centric discussion of the beginnings of Art and Art History, this course seeks to move towards a global history of art.</p>\n\n<p>Class discussions will form the basis for compulsory museum, gallery,&nbsp;site classes to the National Museum of India (New Delhi, contingent on the continutity of the existing institution, physical classes), NGMA (New Delhi, physical classes), Delhi Art Gallery (Delhi,&nbsp;physical classes),&nbsp;National Handloom and Handicrafts Museum (New Delhi, physical classes), Indian Museum, Kolkata (Virtual), British Museum (Virtual), Victoria and Albert Museum (Virtual) and the MET (Virtual) which will enable us to study the works of art in their institutional locations and explore the visual dynamics of organization of exhibition spaces. The gallery, museum and site classes are organized on Saturdays, mutually convenient for the instructor and the students.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>On successful completion of the course, we will be able to:</p>\n\n<p>a) Identify and analyze aspects of works of art and visual images in different material and medium using appropriate vocabulary.<br />\nb) Explore the main trends in the development of Art History and Visual Culture by accessing the critical essential skills.<br />\nc) Evaluate the approaches of artists, art historians, visual anthropologists and curators to the field of visual arts.<br />\nd) Develop the interests for a future training in critical art historical training and art curatorial programme.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>None</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>No prior training in Visual Arts or Art History required.

It will investigate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from multiple angles, incorporating aspects of molecular microbiology, microbial ecology and evolution. The aim is to expose students to how real research stories are built, while simultaneously teaching laboratory tools and techniques such as microbiological methods, PCR, mutagenesis and experimental evolution. Students are expected to participate in generating and evaluating evidence-based data. As a bonus, in cases that yield interesting results, students could also gain the opportunity to further analyse (beyond the class time) and publish their findings, thus gaining valuable research experience. In order to ensure personal attention and hands-on training, the number will be limited to 15 students (groups of 3 X 5). &nbsp;Two trained senior research assistants will be needed to carry out prior preparatory work, organize and help with carrying out the activities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary of course organization:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this 12 week module, students will:</p>\n\n<p>i) &nbsp;Document and analyse local environmental AMR using both culture-based and PCR based approaches</p>\n\n<p>ii) Compare existing clinical with environmental AMR gene data (sequence analysis)</p>\n\n<p>iii) Carry out DNA extractions, PCR and experimental evolution (hands-on)</p>\n\n<p>iv) Understand molecular mechanisms of resistance</p>\n\n<p>v) Track adaptation to antibiotics in laboratory vs environmental bacteria, and attempt to&nbsp; re-sensitize&nbsp;antibiotic resistant strains using bacteriophages, selection and</p>\n\n<p>directed evolution</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;In addition to screening for AMR gene presence, students will also gain exposure to microbial ecology by looking for inhibition of environmental and lab microbes by antibiotic producing bacterial species (Streptomyces sp). Subsequently, we will explore manipulative laboratory-based solutions to tackling AMR via mutagenesis (dry lab only) and directed evolution (experimental). During this process, they will be trained in several lab techniques, analytical thinking, evaluating scientific evidence and good microbiology lab practices. The data on local AMR and specific evolved lines generated by this lab course can serve as a cumulative undergraduate resource over time and be followed up to ask other and deeper questions.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>We will follow the Ashoka rubric.

It is comprehensive introduction to a way of analyzing and researching global politics and international relations that takes gender seriously as a category of analysis. More specifically, it is concerned with how ideas of war, peace, sovereignty, violence, foreign policy, governance and political economy are sustained by specific masculinities and femininities, and how these particular gender constructions impacton the lives of particular groups of men and women. Set against this, the aim of the course is mainly threefold: firstly, to(re)introduce how the discipline has traditionally thought about war and peace; secondly, to reveal the gendered constructions and inequalities that mark the traditional scholarship; and thirdly, to evaluate the specific contribution that feminist critiques have made as part of the so-called &lsquo;Critical Turn&rsquo; in IR. Gender is understood here not as a synonym for &lsquo;woman&rsquo; but as a hierarchical coding of masculinity and femininity that pervades social relations and institutional practices, with systemic (though not deterministic) effects on inequalities. Gender meanings and practices permeate our lives, and a closer look at these processes is more illuminating than many anticipate, with relevance and implications for who we are, how we think, and how we act &ndash; as individuals, groups, communities and nation-states.</p>\n</div></div>",

While magic, science, and religion may seem like stable domains, we examine how the meaning of these categories shifts over time and across contexts, so much so that the difference between them often seems to break down altogether. By focusing on cross-cultural differences in systems of belief, we raise fundamental questions about human nature itself, and the basic human need to interpret and influence events.

In its inverse sense, how might political theory or activity contribute to psychoanalytic reasoning? This course aims to explore intellectual ideas and conversations between primarily these two perspectives, including the disciplinary anxieties and methodologies through which these perspectives are shielded and made relevant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of this term, we shall aim to study in-depth four broad but critical political phenomenon that have not just shaped contemporary psycho-social dynamics but have also remained central to the sense of the political at the level of the personal and the public. These themes are: (i) colonialism, (ii) narcissism and political leadership, (iii) sexuality and psychopathology, (iv) violence and trauma.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Requirements:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lectures: Students are expected to attend all lectures and to have completed the reading assigned for that day before class.

Note: you are encouraged to read the text entirely, but the essential pages are marked below.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Grading: Final grade consists of three components: class participation + a short mid-term essay plan + a final, longer take-home essay. The details of each are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Midterm essay: This short essay-plan will be written as a road map for a question framed by students themselves, drawn from the assigned themes and texts. This should include: what the research question is, how you plan to answer it and what is the value of asking this question. The plan should include a hypothesis, a short literature review and a working bibliography. The length of this assignment is 1500 words. Please avoid late submissions, and extensions will be granted only in documented cases of illness or family emergency. The essay is worth 20% of the final grade. Date of submission: 5th&nbsp;October 2024</p>\n\n<p>Final examination:&nbsp;&nbsp;The final examination will be a take home essay, on questions framed by students. The length of the essay is 3000 words. This is an exercise in writing and research, and it helps to spend an entire semester working on this one paper. Given that the deadline of the submission for the two essays in mentioned in the syllabus already, which is shared with you in the first week of classes itself, please avoid asking for extensions on the deadline. There will be penalties for late submission and extensions will be granted only in verified and documented cases of illness or family emergency. The essay is worth 30% of final grade.</p>\n\n<p>Date of submission: 7th&nbsp;December 2024</p>\n\n<p>Class participation: Apart from the two essays, students will be graded on their class participation, which includes their attendance (20%) and participation through the semester during lectures (30%). The grade on class participation is thus worth 50% of final grade. Students are not allowed more than 5 absences through the term (which includes absences due to participation in university events, and common illnesses. More than 5 absences will lead to a straight F for the course. For any long-term medical assistance and absence (more than three absences in a row), please submit a medical certificate to the OAA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Audit: The requirement to audit the course is simple; please do not be absent for more than five classes.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>No more than 5 absences allowed.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

These models are helpful to analyze a wide range of questions pertaining to business cycles, income distribution, asset pricing etc. The course will start with a discussion of aggregation with heterogeneous agents. It will then consider the benchmark of complete markets and tests of the same, after which it will lay the foundations for models of incomplete markets, emphasizing the precautionary saving motive. These strands will coalesce in the canonical standard incomplete markets model of Bewley-Aiyagari-Huggett.

Defined in this way, the term is not reducible to any single genre, and examples range from the &ldquo;high-&ldquo; to &ldquo;lowbrow.&rdquo; If we understand &quot;cli-fi&quot; as being a literary and cinematic response to the scientific consensus that human activity is warming the planet, then it is a phenomenon of the late 20th and 21st centuries. In this course, however, we will be taking a broader historical approach. For one thing, the history of climate science is almost as old as the fossil fuel economy itself: Svante Arrhenius first described the greenhouse effect in 1896, and he was building on science that goes back at least to the 1850s. But more significantly, pegging climate fiction to atmospheric science implicitly posits a one-way street between scientific discourse and literary production, an assumption that is, put bluntly, wrong. In this course, therefore, we will read not only relatively recent literary texts that dramatize the climate crisis as we understand it today, but also more historical texts that think about the atmosphere both as a geophysical phenomenon as well as an aesthetic one. The course will include literature, theory, and film, with writers and directors ranging from H.G. Wells and Thomas Mann to Alexis Wright, Margaret Atwood, Bong Joon-ho, and Amitav Ghosh. In addition to the big question of representing something as dynamic as the atmospheric system, we will take up related problems such as deep time, the limits of realism and the possibilities of speculative&nbsp;fiction, and questions of environmental justice and ethics.</p>\n</div></div>",

In most cases to meet the demands, industry level synthetic production of the naturally occurring materials such as various polymers or drugs, is required. Everything around us is a product of some sort of chemical reaction. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course offers an introductory level understanding of various processes that take place in organic chemical reactions. Course structure is designed to refresh your chemistry knowledge from your school and to prepare you for your journey towards becoming an expert. It will provide better understanding of all the key concepts that you may require to solve the puzzles of chemical bonding and reactions.</p>\n\n<p>The world of chemistry, and especially organic chemistry, might look scary. However, if fundamental rules and some basic principles are understood, most things start becoming obvious events. Concept of electronegativity, resonance, conjugation, hybridisation, steric effects, and aromaticity are key in explaining the number of complexities found organic chemistry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first question that one might ask is why atoms form molecules, and once they have come close to each other, what keeps them intact. What are the factors that decide the path and the fate of any chemical reaction? The purpose of this course is to make sure that your journey into the realm of organic reactions and all those rule exceptions is more enjoyable!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Contents/Topics:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stereochemistry of simple straight chain and cyclic alkanes</strong></p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Conformational nomenclature: eclipsed, staggered, gauche, syn and anti; dihedral angle, torsion angle</li>\n\t<li>Energy barrier of rotation and relative stability of conformers</li>\n\t<li>Conformational analysis of ethane, propane, n-butane, and 2-methylbutane; cyclohexane and cyclopentane</li>\n\t<li>Geometrical isomerism: cis&ndash;trans, syn-anti, and E/Z notations with C.I.P rules.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Organic Acids and Bases</strong></p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Hybridisation, Inductive effects, Hyperconjugation, Mesomeric effects, and Steric effect and their effect on acidity/basicity</li>\n\t<li>Concept of pKa and pKaH, effect of structure, substituent and solvent on acidity and basicity; proton sponge</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Addition and Elimination Reactions</strong></p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Elimination reactions: formation of alkenes and alkynes; mechanisms, reactivity, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity</li>\n\t<li>Addition Reactions of alkenes and alkynes: Mechanism, reactivity, regioselectivity (Markownikoff and anti-Markownikoff addition) and stereoselectivity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Interconversion of functional groups</strong></p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Oxidation of alcohols to form aldehyde/ketone &amp; carboxylic acids</li>\n\t<li>Oxidation and reduction of aldehydes to form carboxylic acids &amp; alcohols</li>\n\t<li>Conversion of carboxylic acid into acid chlorides, esters, amides and reduction to alcohols</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>Students will develop understanding about the factors that make an organic compound acidic or basic.

Although it is no longer a requisite skill for contemporary artists, a high proportion would still agree that irrespective of whatever material they might choose to work in, they &lsquo;think&rsquo; in terms of drawings. Drawing is more than simply a skill in that it offers a path to self-discovery, revealing a cast of mind, an imaginative capacity, and a mode of perception.</p>\n\n<p>This course encourages students to re-think and re-imagine the human body beyond a representational image, as an entity with constant trans-mutative possibilities regarding form, functionality, and aesthetics. Through a combination of practice and discourse, the course encourages explorations beyond human anatomy by focusing on the varied manifestations and meanings ascribed to the human figure, vis-&agrave;-vis the body, in the context of visual art and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Students will be introduced to contemporary artistic practices and deliberations on artistic visions, experiences, and wisdom that push the boundaries of accepted notions of &lsquo;high&rsquo; art and critique hierarchies of attitude. Tracing the history of figure drawing as a genre that goes back to Classical antiquity to the Italian Renaissance, extending into the 18th-century French academia and the 19th-century Victorian Era, students will get a broad overview of how the established notion of accuracy and idealized beauty continues to be challenged and reinvented as artists take on a variety of approaches to drawing the human figure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course looks at how the idealized notion of body is challenged and replaced with bodies that are bruised, grotesque, and out of proportion with visible stretch marks, skin hair, wrinkles, and pigmentation. How has the conscious shift towards drawing from memory and imagination as opposed to drawing from a live model or from photographic references allowed artists to create works that are often loaded with political commentary and emotive power?</p>\n\n<p>In this course, students have the flexibility to work with both analog and digital mediums and materials enabling them to connect to their context, concerns, and interests with a sense of immediacy by using the human figure as a trigger.</p>\n\n<p>The frameworks we will be working through the course include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Understanding the various kinds of representations of the human figure - from different social and cultural contexts. Locating discursive modes of representation.</li>\n\t<li>Probing ideas of beauty, identity, sexuality, and gender, through human form.</li>\n\t<li>Understanding space-time and memory in the context of the human body and its representation.</li>\n\t<li>Exploring the human figure in contemporary drawings under the broad categorizations of the body, self, personal lives, social reality, and fiction.</li>\n\t<li>Reflecting on processes of overlapping, erasures, and incision as acts layered with emotive and intuitive sensibilities.</li>\n\t<li>Developing an individual methodology /strategy for figurative drawing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The course will unfold over three modules; each spread over four weeks respectively, and will include both theoretical readings and practical assignments. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Module 1</p>\n\n<p>The human figure in visual arts:</p>\n\n<p>A historical perspective, a cultural and social perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Representing human body- a repository of concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Overview- Western naturalism through Renaissance, Human form in Egyptian Drawing, Indian painting and Human form.</p>\n\n<p>Basic observational drawings.</p>\n\n<p>Portraiture and history painting.</p>\n\n<p>The renaissance body- Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael, Durer</p>\n\n<p>Representing flesh and desire- Boucher, Ingre, Rubens,</p>\n\n<p>Modernity and Body - Humor, satire and politics of&nbsp; expressing the Body in painting, sculpture.

This was reflected in their imperial titles like Jahangir (Conqueror of the World), Shah Jahan (King of the World), and Alamgir (Conqueror of the Universe). However, how much power did they actually wield? How did they use paintings and architecture to articulate their grand visions of power? What role did war, diplomacy, ideology, and religion play in the process of imperial expansion? These are some of the questions we will engage with. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Mughal history and historiography. We will explore how the legacy of Chinghiz Khan and Amir Timur Gurgan shaped the empire in South Asia. We will look into the ideals of masculinity that animated Mughal courtly etiquette and study the role of Mughal women in court society. We will investigate how the empire legitimised its rule, disciplined its elite, and created its fabled riches. Finally, we will study why such a huge and prosperous empire fragmented away in the eighteenth century.</p>\n\n<p>NB: This History elective is corss-listed with Political Science.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of the semester, students will have a firm understanding of various facets of the Mughal Empire as well as the myriad ways in which modern scholars have looked at this rich and complex history.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>Class Participation - 25%</li>\n\t<li>Mid-Term Presentation - 35%</li>\n\t<li>Term Paper 40%</li>\n</ul>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Out of the 25&nbsp;classes of this course, you are required to attend at least 20.

You will engage with a variety of source materials and understand how to ask questions that extend and enrich your understanding -- of situations, texts, institutions and people. You will explore the distinctness of academic research and writing, and participate in an active knowledge community constituted by your peers. By the close of the course, you will have a clearer understanding of what it means to be a scholar in an academic setting, and a keener sense of your own processes of learning, thinking and writing.</p>\n\n<p>The theme this semester is Environmentalism Desi-Style where we read writings by Vandana Shiva, Amita Baviskar, Mahesh Rangarajan, Nagaraj Adve, Arpitha Kodiveri,&nbsp; examine miscellaneous news reports, social media posts, and&nbsp;opinion pieces, and watch short films, videos and reels together&nbsp;to explore how environmentalism might mean different things for different people in South Asia, and how it has different ramifications in our part of the world than it does in the West.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, our classroom will be a safe space for discussion, debate and constructive disagreements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I like my classes to be as interactive and discussive as possible. All the same, if you feel unsure or diffident about speaking up in class, please do not worry; there will be many ways in which I can continue to get a sense of how you feel about various things under discussion, via the weekly blog, other written submissions, and our chats during office hours.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>1. Breaking down texts into identifiable parts.</p>\n\n<p>2. Making patterns and connections across texts</p>\n\n<p>3. Building reading stamina and the ability to select texts</p>\n\n<p>4. Understanding textual context, genre and source material and documenting these via strategic note-making.</p>\n\n<p>Writing&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. Developing the craft of outlining, revising, editing</p>\n\n<p>2. Applying form, voice, style, tone to affect writing</p>\n\n<p>3. Developing logical, coherent, structured writing</p>\n\n<p>4. Using explanatory, narrative and justificatory writing</p>\n\n<p>Thinking</p>\n\n<p>1. Practising converting thoughts into words</p>\n\n<p>2. Narrowing down a curiosity or thought into a question</p>\n\n<p>3. Constructing and developing a reasoned argument</p>\n\n<p>4. Engaging meaningfully with multiple perspectives</p>\n\n<p>Speaking-Listening</p>\n\n<p>1. Aiming for confidence, clarity, coherence&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2. Practising and harnessing audience engagement&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3. Developing active and respectful listening to others&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4. Engaging meaningfully with ongoing discussions</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You can expect to do regular reading (of academic texts and wider materials) in this course. These will be specified on a weekly basis on the schedule at the end of this outline. In addition, you can expect to write consistently, participate in giving and taking feedback, and work on medium-term projects both individually and in collaboration with your course mates.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The ICT will be graded on a rubric. The weightage of the elements, their exact definition, and the decision to add new elements, will be equally divided between the following parameters:</p>\n\n<p>1. Participation (in classes, office hours, and the weekly blog)</p>\n\n<p>2. Research paper (a longform argumentative paper with citations, written in academic style)</p>\n\n<p>3. Small summative written assignments (including a literature review mid-term)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4. Presentations in class (including a group-based semester-end Debate)</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>For this course, you are allowed three unexcused absences (for which you do not need permission from the instructor) and two excused absences (for which you do need permission from the instructor).

The second half of the course focuses on three key empirical techniques for causal identification: namely differences-in-difference, regression discontinuity designs, matching and instrumental variables. The course will focus mainly on the intuition behind causal identification and applying them in practice. A critical component of the course would be reading empirical academic papers.

In this course we will learn how they do so in astronomy and cosmology, which are different from physics in one fundamental respect: in physics we can do experiments to test our hypotheses, but in astronomy and cosmology we cannot. Fortunately, the fundamental laws of physics, tested through Earth-based experiments, have been applicable to the entire universe since the beginning (so far as we can tell). This point is important because we can see the universe only as it was in the past, since all information-bearing signals &mdash; in particular light, the most important of signals &mdash; must travel at finite speed. Thus the signals received from an object record not the present but the moment in the past when they were emitted. When combined with the vast distances that separate objects in the universe, this leads to the astonishing conclusion that a deep snapshot of the universe from any point taken &ldquo;at any moment&rdquo; is actually a snapshot of the history of the universe. We might ask why information cannot be transmitted instantaneously. The answer is embedded in the fabric of space and time, which is described by Einstein&rsquo;s special theory of relativity. And the fabric of space and time, we will discover, is modified by the presence of the matter that occupies it. The modification of space and time by matter is the understanding due to Einstein of what we normally call the force of gravity. But of course gravity, as we all know, was first understood by Newton; so we start there.</p>\n\n<p>Newton&rsquo;s version of gravity correctly describes familiar phenomena like the motion of planets around the Sun. What is less obvious is that gravity can be used to discover planets. This method was first used to discover Neptune, and has been used extensively to discover exoplanets, i.e. planets outside the solar system. In the first part of this course we will figure out how exoplanets can be revealed by Newton&rsquo;s theory of gravity, and in the process learn how it and physics work. In the second part of the course, we will understand how the nature of space and time results in a maximum speed for all signals. In the third part we will talk briefly about the way in which massive objects, for example black holes, modify the space-time around them. And in the final part we will try to understand how the universe &mdash; i.e. space-time with all that it contains &mdash; has evolved since the beginning and how it may end.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning how science works, and, in the process, learning how amazing our universe is.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Pre-requisites: None.</p>\n\n<p>Books and online resources: No books.

Almost all High School graduates have studied science in school. However, almost invariably the science they studied mostly were about the products of science and not the process behind the product (discoveries or inventions), disconnected with the person(s) responsible for the discovery or the invention or the role of the society and funding. The aim of this course is to make students aware about how science is done. This will include how discoveries or inventions are made, how society, including the media or the state, responds, how prizes are awarded (or not awarded) for discoveries, how the nature of science has changed from being the pursuit of isolated individuals to Big Science, where a large number of people collaborate worldwide, and how science can be used to understand global issues like epidemics, climate change or the large scale environmental pollution, all immediate concerns for humanity at large.</p>\n\n<p>Summary: In this course we will be exploring scientific discoveries and inventions, stories behind the discoveries, people associated with the discoveries, response of the society, the state and the media to discoveries, including recognitions and awards. This will be accomplished through lectures, readings, discussions, student seminars on self-assigned topics and/or assigned by the instructors, interviewing scientists at Ashoka University after reading some of their select publications in primary journals, and by enacting a play (Oxygen by Carl Djerassi and Roald Hoffmann).</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Outcome: At the end of the course it is expected that students will be more aware of the process of science as a human pursuit, albeit special, that operates with tacit support from the society, and with far reaching implications of the inventions and discoveries, often beyond what the discoverer ever imagined. It will also inculcate scientific temperament and make the younger generation aware of global catastrophes that the planet currently faces like epidemics, climate change and environmental pollution.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>None</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Presentations and regular assignments.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Although no formal attendance will be registered, the assigments will be difficut to do without attending classes.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/Deconstructing_Discoveries_520e38fe-126b-46eb-b57d-fd0bb4f47437.pdf'>Deconstructing_Discoveries_520e38fe-126b-46eb-b57d-fd0bb4f47437.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

A story migrates in a variety of ways &ndash; from the teller to the audience or reader; but also from reader to reader, place to place, and culture to culture, as the story gets told and retold (or written and rewritten) over space and time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We live in a capitalist age when ideas of private property have subtly colonized how we think about stories.&nbsp; It is assumed that a story is always BY someone, and is therefore their possession.&nbsp; But if stories migrate, can a single author really claim full ownership of the story she has written?&nbsp; How is every story a re-imagining of another story, or many stories, that have become before?</p>\n\n<p>The notion that a story is an author&rsquo;s private intellectual property also inhibits how we read.&nbsp; Readers become potential trespassers; they must pay the price of admission, and then act respectfully when they enter the property, making sure not to damage or alter it.&nbsp; If you are a student of literature, it&rsquo;s likely that the command to respect an author&rsquo;s private property will be accompanied by the assumption that the objective of literary analysis is simply to understand what the author intended, and to submit to that deferentially.&nbsp; But if stories migrate from teller to reader, and from reader to reader and culture to culture, maybe the act of reading should not be thought of just as a respectful encounter with an author&rsquo;s private property.&nbsp; Every act of reading instead becomes a creative re-imagining of the story, in conversation with new potential readers and audiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If stories are migrants, then they are no longer individual property by authors who command their readers.&nbsp; They are collective artefacts that invite us to respond creatively and re-imagine them anew.</p>\n\n<p>If you doubt what I am saying, think this.&nbsp; Do any two readers respond exactly the same way to a story?&nbsp; Each reader, when asked about a story and what it meant, will retell it slightly differently.&nbsp; Recognizing that reading is a form of creative re-imagining is one of this course&rsquo;s most important themes.</p>\n\n<p>As stories migrate across space, time, and languages, they are re-imagined by the world across many genres and media &ndash; poems, plays, novels, essays, films, graphic novels. &nbsp;These re-imaginings might prove that, in literature, there is nothing original under the sun.&nbsp; Yet how literature reimagines earlier stories also tells us a lot about the extraordinarily diverse ways in which different cultures have understood the world: relations between men and women, relations between diverse ethnicities and religions, the nature of political and social power, humans&rsquo; relations to the animal and plant world, the agonies and ecstasies of love, and the nature of imagination itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How, for example, is a Roman re-imagining of an old Greek story about an Asian witch re-imagined by an English playwright in an &ldquo;American&rdquo; drama that has itself been re-imagined in very different ways by writers and artists from the Caribbean, Sierra Leone, Mauritius, and Samoa?&nbsp; How is a Roman re-imagining of a Babylonian (ie Iraqi) love story reworked by the same English playwright in a Greek mythic tale with an Asian subtext that gets in turn re-imagined by a Bombay director in Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu and English as well as by an English graphic novelist in a reworking of an American comic-book hero&rsquo;s saga based on a character from a German short story?&nbsp; And how is an antique Persian story about an African migrant re-imagined in an Arab novel and then re-imagined by the same English playwright, whose play is then diversely re-imagined by a Sudanese novelist and a Hindi film-maker from Uttar Pradesh?&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&nbsp;

Does literature put us more genuinely in touch with ourselves and one another? What is the relation between literature and politics? Or literature and religion? In this course, we will search for answers to some of these questions by reading modern literature from all over the world. We will be studying literary texts by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka, Ryunosuke Akutagawa, V.S.

For example, in contexts such as &ldquo;World Affairs,&rdquo; &ldquo;World Commerce,&rdquo; or &ldquo;World Literature,&rdquo; we encounter the &ldquo;world&rdquo; almost as an adjective that points to a sense of vastness or universality. This sense of immensity is also conveyed in expressions like such and such or so and so, &ldquo;means the world to me.&rdquo; Such a usage relates to yet another sense in which one may understand the &ldquo;world,&rdquo; and that is as a horizon or locus of one&rsquo;s individual and shared perceptions and experiences. Extending from such a personal sense of the word and contrary to universality or immensity, an expression like, &ldquo;You and I come from very different worlds,&rdquo; expresses a seeming incommensurability across individual and subjective experiences.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">In this course we will be working towards understanding this unique and exceptional elasticity of the &ldquo;world&rdquo; as an idea or a concept, and as a lived reality through its representations in literature. We will be reading a wide sampling of texts such as Banarasidas&rsquo; <em>Ardhakathanak</em>, Albert Camus&rsquo; <em>The Outsider</em>, Alice Walker&#39;s <em>The Color Purple</em> and Vaikom Muhammad Basheer&rsquo;s <em>Me Grandad &#39;ad an Elephant</em>. As we encounter and navigate these fictive and literary worlds, we will also be reflecting on ways in which we understand our place and the place of others in the world(s) that we live in.</span></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\"><u><strong>Assessment Plan</strong></u></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\"><u>#BeingintheWorld: 20 points</u></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Over the course of the semester, you will be sharing a total of 10 posts on a Social Media platform of your choosing.

But can storytelling bring about revolutions? Is it possible for stories to stand up against colonial abuse, fight prejudices, bring social change, impact public<br />\npolicy? In this course, we will talk about stories that did exactly that and did it so spectacularly that generations have remained in awe of them. We will read novels, short stories, memoirs and essays to discover that each of these works of art were responsible for protesting against the injustices of their times. And in doing so, they highlighted and gave voice to the wrongs and<br />\ndiscriminations of today.

That said, the assignments have been designed to present you with multiple and varied<br />\nopportunities to demonstrate your learning: for example, you can demonstrate learning through your participation in discussion, your collaboration with other students, your involvement in the<br />\nwriting process, the overall quality of your written essay, the sophistication and seriousness of your research, and your ability to think critically and creatively.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are allowed a maximum of two unexcused absences.

If you miss a class for any other reason (sudden illness, family emergency, etc.), please keep the lines of<br />\ncommunication open by getting in touch with me as soon as possible. Due Dates and Late Work Policies All written assignments are due at the beginning of class on the date which they are due.

Is it a mindset, a literary genre, a political philosophy, or something else? Is it a place that we would want to inhabit? Why, despite so often being dismissed as idealistic fantasy, is utopia such an enduring and appealing idea?</p>\n\n<p>Using these questions as starting points, this course offers a theoretical and historical overview of utopian thinking across time and space. We will examine the rise of utopia as a European literary genre by reading Thomas More&rsquo;s Utopia and Francis Bacon&rsquo;s New Atlantis alongside canonical theories of utopia by Ernst Bloch and Fredric Jameson. We will connect these early utopias to the later genre of science fiction and speculative fiction as we read works by Ursula LeGuin and Marge Piercy. At the same time, the course complicates this history by examining utopias from before the early modern period (such as the Land of Cockaigne and Christine&rsquo;s de Pizan&rsquo;s City of Ladies) as well as those that come from outside a predominantly male and western lineage (Charlotte Perkins Gilman&rsquo;s Herland and Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain&rsquo;s The Sultana&rsquo;s dream). We will conclude by considering utopian thinking beyond the literary in the records of real-world utopias. In our readings and discussions, we will aim not to develop not a single definition of utopia but rather to gain an understanding of the many ways in which utopia (and its seeming opposite dystopia) has and continues to be a vital aesthetic and political tool.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>A: Exceptional, original work on assignments &amp; in class performance.

With the help of some simplifying frameworks and models, the students will be equipped to develop a series of applications of principles from finance and economics that explore the connection between financial markets, financial institutions and the broader economy. Students will learn how the term structure of interest rates, stock and derivative market developments and currency fluctuations drive the financial flows. Students will study the role of financial institutions such as central banks, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and mutual funds in facilitating the flow of funds in the economy. Keynesian IS-LM theory and the loanable funds theory provide the theoretical background for the course and help students develop simple analytical frameworks to study the interaction of individuals, firms, governments, markets, financial institutions, and the aggregate economy.

It determines the profits of firms through the cost of inputs, market size, the level of competition, and the policy environment they face. It also determines the job opportunities, schooling, and other amenities accessible to individuals. In turn, firm and individual decisions aggregate to determine the performance of cities and regions.</p>\n\n<p>This course studies business and individual location decisions and how they determine the main economic forces (agglomeration economies) that lead to the existence and performance of cities and<br role=\"presentation\" />\nregional agglomerations. The course starts by developing a simple theory of cities (the monocentric city model)&nbsp;and its implications for density, city size&nbsp;and housing prices. We will study the internal structure of cities by introducing the key notion of spatial equilibrium, and then evaluate the effects of land use policies, different means of transportation and infrastructure and housing policies on land and housing values. We shall also consider spatial equilibrium across a region using the framework of Rosen and Roback.</p>\n\n<p>We shall also briefly consider the empirical literature that seeks to test some of the theories developed. Other topics that will be covered, time permitting,&nbsp;include&nbsp;urban governance, urban growth and decline and more<br role=\"presentation\" />\nlocal aspects such as neighbourhood choice and gentrification. Finally, the course will analyze cities in the developing world, and conclude with recent advances in the field.</p>\n\n<p><canvas height=\"1658\" width=\"1280\"></canvas></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students should gain&nbsp;an understanding of the forces that drive the formation of cities and the patterns of location and prices within cities.

Is it simply something that we needed for trading? If so, then&nbsp;money would be a constraint - a thing without which trades can&#39;t happen. What about alternative trading arrangements like barter or credit? Why&nbsp;is barter, credit, or a system that keeps track of transfers, inferior to money? Why is fiat money Pareto superior to commodity money (gold, silver, etc.)? What causes inflation? What about banking - why do we need it? Are banks&nbsp;always welfare-improving? Why do banks fail?&nbsp;This course starts with a micro-founded approach to money using an overlapping generations model and discusses why money is not a constraint but an instrument that arises endogenously leading to welfare gains for the economy. Then we build on this model and go on to study the relationship between money and other institutions that issue/ use money - financial intermediation &amp; banks, a model of bank risk and bank panic (Diamond-Dybvig model).</p>\n\n<p>Time permitting and based on your collective interest &amp; my expertise, we might cover other interesting topics in monetary economics such as national debt, fiscal theories of price level &amp; inflation, pension systems,&nbsp;and/ or one or two&nbsp;MA/ Ph.D. level papers on money-related topics.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Components</strong></p>\n\n<p>Midterm 1: 20% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nMidterm 2: 20% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nHomework: 8% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nPop Quizzes: 7% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nFinal Exam: 35% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nParticipation (including attendance): 10% weightage</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Points to note</strong></p>\n\n<p>Pop quizzes are random&nbsp;quizzes (i.e. not pre-announced)&nbsp;that could be given&nbsp;on any lecture day.

For example, if there are a total of 6 pop quizzes, I will drop the lowest 2 scores. If there are 5 pop quizzes, I will drop the lowest 2 scores.&nbsp;If there are 4 pop quizzes, I will drop the lowest score.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If your score on the Final Exam is better than your lowest midterm, I&nbsp;am willing to drop your lowest midterm and scale up the score on the final exam by a factor of (35+20)/35 = 1.571 (approx)<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your Total Score will be calculated according to:<br />\nTotal Score = maximum of Method 1 Score and Method 2 Score rounded up to zero decimal places, where<br />\nMethod 1 Score = Midterm 1 + Midterm 2 + HW +&nbsp;Pop Quiz&nbsp;+ Participation + Final<br />\nMethod 2 Score = max(Midterm 1, Midterm 2) +&nbsp;HW + Pop Quiz + Participation + (55/35)*Final</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How difficult is this course?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Median grade usually hovers in the B to B+ zone; some cohorts are better than others and their median grade has&nbsp;been between B+ and&nbsp;A-.

Amongst them will be prospect theory and the theme of reference-dependent preferences; sequential choice procedures featuring multiple rationales; choice theories featuring limited consideration; theories of temptation and self-control.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the second topic, we will examine the foundations of subjective probabilities and Bayesianism. We will study the classic approaches of De Finetti, Savage, and Anscombe-Aumann to this question. After that, we will focus on the large and impressive literature on decision-making under ambiguity that has emerged in the last three decades or so. Ambiguity, here, refers to decision settings in which a decision-maker perceives &ldquo;uncertainty about probability, created by missing information that is relevant and could be known&rdquo; (Frisch and Baron, 1988). That such decision settings exist was pointed out by Ellsberg (1961). His work showed how ambiguity represents a normative criticism of the subjective expected utility framework of Savage (1954) and, by extension, of the Bayesian paradigm. David Schmeidler&rsquo;s work in the late 1980s revived interest in this area of research. We will cover important models like Schmeidler&rsquo;s Choquet expected utility, Gilboa and Schmeidler&rsquo;s maximin expected utility, Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji&rsquo;s smooth ambiguity model, and Siniscalchi&rsquo;s vector expected utility. Before getting to all this, though, we will first look at a few landmark models of decision-making under risk like vNM expected utility and rank-dependent utility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the third topic, we will look at the Luce model and its generalizations, random utility and random expected utility model, and random consideration models.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

We will look at how places, cultures and people are constructed through representations &mdash; visual and written &mdash; both by &lsquo;outsiders&rsquo; as well as local communities. Utilising interdisciplinary methodologies borrowing from visual anthropology, material culture studies, museology and history, students will engage with critical questions about the ethics of representation in imaging &lsquo;other&rsquo; places and people, the socio-political processes that inform the making of tradition, and the entanglements of politics and culture in the formation of regional and national identities.</p>\n\n<p>We will read a contemporary novel, early travel accounts, do a deep dive into colonial and contemporary photography, watch films and look at representations in popular culture. Through field visits to a Tibetan exile settlement and a museum in Delhi, we will study material culture in relationship to its uses and the recontextualization of sacred objects within museum spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the questions we will explore include: How are cultures constructed through acts of museumisation? How did the field of &lsquo;Himalayan Art&rsquo; emerge? Where do we &lsquo;locate&rsquo; this field; which geographical areas and religions are made emblematic of this discipline; which cultures are excluded and why? How were museum collections built and in what historical circumstances? What curatorial strategies are used to reconstruct the auras of objects? How are sacred objects of use segregated into categories of art and ethnography?</p>\n\n<p>We will also examine the recent museum-making impulse in the Himalayas through case studies of a range of museums situated in these borderlands &mdash; war memorial museums, community museums of conflict and trade route artefacts, and museums in Buddhist monasteries to understand the relationship between heritage and religion, the impact of the movement of things from sacred sites to &lsquo;secular&rsquo; museums, and to ask how a politics of remembrance may manifest in cultural production. The course will conclude with an introduction to Tibetan/ Buddhist culture-in-exile through contemporary Tibetan art, poetry, writing and films.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of the course, students:<br />\n&bull; will be familiar with the broad field of the visual and material cultures in the Western Himalayas in Tibet, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh.<br />\n&bull; will learn about major museums and collections of Himalayan Art and be able to critically analyze the framing of objects as art or ethnography, and questions of provenance research and label writing in object displays.<br />\n&bull; will be conversant with critical questions around heritage, the politics of museums and the role of tradition in the construction of contemporary cultural identities.<br />\n&bull; will acquire the critical tools interrogate the nature and impact of &lsquo;representation&rsquo; of regions, cultures and communities through images and written texts.<br />\n&bull; will be able to analyse and read images and texts, with a focus on meaning making through vocabularies and terminologies, and apply this critical thinking in a curatorial project.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Select Bibliography:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&bull; Anand, Dibyesh. &ldquo;Western Colonial Representations of the Other- The Case of Exotica Tibet&rdquo;, New Political Science 29 (1) March 2007, 23-42.<br />\n&bull; Appadurai, Arjun. &ldquo;The Production of locality&rdquo; Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, University of Minnesota Press, 1996,178-200.<br />\n&bull; Appadurai, Arjun. &ldquo;Putting Hierarchy in its Place&rdquo; Cultural Anthropology Vol. 3, No. 1, Place and Voice in Anthropological Theory (Feb., 1988), pp. 36-49.<br />\n&bull; Banerjee, Sandeep. &ldquo;Not Altogether Unpicturesque: Samuel Bourne and the Landscaping of the Victorian Himalaya&rdquo;, Victorian Literature and Culture, Vol. 42, No. 3 (2014), Cambridge University Press, 351-368.<br />\n&bull; Bishop, Peter (2000) The Sacred Myth of Shangri-La: Tibet, Travel Writing and the Western Creation of Sacred Landscape.

However, implicated in their answers are hundreds of years of social, economic, and political thought. In this course, we will engage with different social, political, and economic ideas that have changed the way we look and interact with the world, and for this purpose, we will go straight to the horse&rsquo; mouth. In other words, we will read and engage with texts written by some of the greatest social, economic, and political thinkers from around the world such as Marx, Ambedkar, Berger &amp; Luckmann, Weber, bell hooks, and Foucault.

Does freedom for media necessarily mean democratic freedom? What if free media translates into corporatized control over media platforms, algorithms, content,&nbsp;eventually publics themselves? How do we reconcile the rise of digital technologies that evoke&nbsp;narratives of emancipation, autonomy, and freedom- with the simultaneous rise of online troll cultures, virulent racism, sexism, xenophobia, and exclusionary political ideologies around the globe? Answers to questions such as these depend, to begin with, on how we approach understandings of media, democracy,&nbsp;or freedom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will think about mediation as social process that extends beyond &lsquo;the media&rsquo;- not as power emanating from specific objects, technologies, or institutional practices, but as the ideological foundation of social life. We explore the relationships of media with electoral democracy and its political institutions, but also what they mean for ordinary people outside of its formal and elite institutions:&nbsp;their local meanings and practices, contestations and shifting forms of power, and the multiplicity of desires they both produce and represent. Towards these objectives, we&nbsp;examine actions of governments that relate to repression of media and democratic freedoms- and the struggles to liberate them; but also, how mor&shy;ally loaded concepts such as `freedom&rsquo; are given particular meanings in their discourses and social practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The challenge in this course will be to both apprehend the dominant configurations of `media&rsquo; and `democracy&rsquo; in present times,&nbsp;as well as anticipate imaginations of their possible forms and praxis that might provide for a more diverse and equal world.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

It takes a micro and macro, sectorial and broader, and a local and global view, to understand the complex and wide nature of environmental governance in India. With case studies from government and non-government sectors, civil society organisations, and movement groups in different spaces, locations and times, the course explains environmental management and regulation in theoretical and practical terms.

It is motivated by a set of perplexing observations about armed conflict in India. First, India&rsquo;s response to civil wars (or insurgencies) involves both massive levels of violence to coerce communities into obedience, and extensive distribution of development funds to induce loyalty. Do these strategies complement or contradict each other? What is the long-term effect of these strategies?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Second, India has an impressive track record in defeating armed groups, but it struggles to resolve conflicts. Regions like Kashmir, Nagaland, and Manipur continue to remain affected by low levels of violence. Why?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Third, India&rsquo;s governing institutions do not fritter away. Generally, we do not notice a complete breakdown of law and order that often leads to large-scale migration in other countries. Instead, civil administration remains robust and even expands during civil wars. How does India succeed in avoiding the World Bank&rsquo;s conflict-trap hypothesis, wherein armed conflict depletes state&rsquo;s capacity and creates conditions for future conflict?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, even as India limits fundamental rights (such as right to assembly, right to speech and opinion) through the Armed Forces Special Powers Act time and again, it is eager to resume electoral democracy. Why? Why not just continue with the President&rsquo;s Rule?&nbsp;From Kashmir to Nagaland, elections in conflict zones register exceptionally high participation. Yet, contrary to the convention that voting is an indicator of legitimacy, surveys and ethnographies show that communities affected by conflict do not positively associate with Indian identity, or at the very least, their identification with Indian nationalism is tenuous. How do democratic institutions operate in conflict zones where political rights are limited by the threat of violence by both sides?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To understand these seemingly contradictory observations, one must look beyond the literature on civil war. The course, therefore, is a compliment to Militants or Freedom Fighters? Armed Conflicts in India (familiarity with the civil war literature is not essential to understand content in <em>Nations..</em>) that examines civil wars in India through the lens of major works&nbsp;of civil wars.&nbsp;Nation and State-Making in India&rsquo;s Borders will use canonical works of nationalism, state formation, organised violence, and the politics of development as pillars to guide our search for answers to these vexing questions. Equipped with the knowledge of theory, we will study detailed case studies and collectively discuss the most convincing explanations for patterns of nation and state-making in India&rsquo;s contested borderlands.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goals of the course are three-fold. By the end of the course, students should have an overview of some of the major debates in the political science of nation and state-making (or state-formation). We will collectively grapple with understanding linkages between state and nation-making with civil wars. In doing so, the course will also familiarise students with major civil wars (or &lsquo;insurgencies&rsquo;) in India through detailed case studies. Finally, the course will reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please note - below are readings from the previous iteration of the course.

It is commonly known that Mizoram transitioned to post-war peace and Nagaland continues to be affected by low levels of violence. Less known, but arguably a greater difference lies in the crystallisation of a homogenous identity and a cohesive state in Mizoram (in stark contrast to what we witnessed in Nagaland). Understanding this key difference will be our goal for the lecture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This meeting will explore the history of Mizo society and state development, and of course, the factors that led to the two-decade long conflict.&nbsp; Sajjad Hassan is a former IAS officer of the Manipur cadre who wrote this book while on a study leave at LSE.

Like Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur comprises different ethnic groups. Unlike JK, the constituent ethnic groups have been in conflict with India and with each other. To grasp competing ethnic mobilizations, we need to understand how communities carry out collective action internally (within the group) and externally (between groups). We will rely on Robert Putnam, a giant in the field of comparative politics. Here is a quick reading guide -&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Start with skimming Chapter 1 of Making Democracy Work to understand the book&rsquo;s basic question - Why does everything - economic, public safety, representational democracy - work well in Northern Italy but not in Southern Italy. Follow-up with closer reading of selections of Chapter 4 that explain Putnam&rsquo;s answer - civic traditions of joining voluntary associations in Northern Italy (remember Wimmer?) creates rich social capital that is key to all the good outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Once you are familiar with social capital, read Bowling Alone. Context - in Bowling Alone, Putnam laments/chronicles&nbsp; the demise of bowling clubs in the US, as a metaphor for civic traditions. Selections of Chapter 1 introduces ties within a group (bonding ties) and ties across social groups (bridging ties). Finish with Chapter 22 (The Dark Side of Social Capital) which, for me, was the most provocative part of the two books. Voluntary associations create fraternity, but do they come at the cost of individual freedom?&nbsp; Are we better off Bowling Alone?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Putnam, Robert D., Robert Leonardi, and Raffaella Nanetti. 1993.

This chapter on Manipur completes the comparative fold. The chapter provides a historical view of the Manipur state. Skim the sections on the hill regions, since you will be covering the topic in Piang&rsquo;s EPW article. Focus on the valley instead and pay special attention on two themes:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Social bases of the state. Remember the inclusive bases of the Mizo state? In contrast, did all social groups in Manipur (by the way, which are the major social groups in Manipur?) buy into the formation of the post-colonial Manipur state project?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What was the effect of executive rule through central bureaucrats in Manipur (before it became a full-fledged state)? To bring this into comparative perspective - Assam-based bureaucrats worsened conflict in Naga and Mizo cases, remember? Central executive rule produced a positive effect in NEFA. In Ladakh, central executive rule was initially welcomed in 2019 and later regretted. We have enough variation to ask questions and develop theoretical answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hassan, Sajjad. 2007.

These ideas and ideals are expressed through concepts, such as liberty, justice, democracy, nationalism, constitutionalism, secularism, and the like. Political concepts, therefore,&nbsp;mediate our understanding and representation of reality. At the same time, concepts also get rearticulated in the process of this interaction with socio-political reality. While political concepts shape and in turn are shaped by social reality, they also develop and therefore are placed within a larger theoretical field of political theory. Political theory is the sub-field of political science. Because understanding political concepts and ideas are important to study politics, students studying political science should take at least one course in political theory.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main approaches to political theory: history of political thought, which studies the development and history of ideas; and political philosophy, which studies political ideas systematically. Students can meet their political theory requirement through a course in either of the traditions. Introduction to Political Theory focuses on political philosophy, although we will also read some texts which make reference to historical ideas from both Europe and India.</p>\n\n<p>The course is divided into four big parts: i) Democracy and Constitutionalism; ii) Liberalism and Secularism; iii) Social Justice; iv) Nationalism. We begin by studying democracy and constitutionalism. Is there a will of the people? Is democracy possible? Is constitutionalism a compromise with democracy? Constitutionalism is often associated with liberalism and secularism. The second part discusses these ideas. What is the basis for human rights? How should we understand secularism? Do liberty and equality conflict? This last question points towards another domain of politics: social justice. In the third part we look more closely at social justice. We look at questions of caste, class, and gender. Some of these questions are often framed as identity politics. If identity politics draws attention to our immediate or primordial identities, such as caste and gender, how do we understand larger identities, such as nationalism and cosmopolitanism? The fourth and the last section on nationalism draws attention to such issues. In this course students will thus engage with political concepts by studying the various ways in which ideas and politics shape and in turn are shaped by political concepts.</p>\n</div></div>",

We will begin with a simple overlapping generations (OLG) model where intrinsically worthless objects are valued at equilibrium. This is fiat money.</p>\n\n<p>After this, we will quickly graduate to the Lagos-Rocheteau-Wright (LRW) class of models a.k.a. New Monetarist models, and use them to understand different aspects of monetary economies and how a monetary economy interacts with other markets &ndash; labor markets, asset markets, and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Time permitting, we will also study Choi and Rocheteau (2021) models which are continuous time versions of LRW models and yield richer dynamics.</p>\n\n<p>In the last phase of the course, we will discuss selected papers on important and interesting issues in monetary economics. Some of these might be &ldquo;current issues&rdquo;, while the rest are perennial questions. Students taking the course must select a paper from a predefined list and present it in class.

At this stage of education, participation in class and engagement with the course is both expected and desired of you. <strong>You are all grown-ups, ready to face the world - I shouldn&#39;t have to&nbsp;coax and cajole you to come to class or encourage you to study. </strong>In this course, I will be more of a guide by the side than a sage on the stage. I will teach you some seminal models and how certain aspects of monetary economies can be analyzed through the lens of these models, but the rest is up to you to discover. I will give you a map and you need to explore yourself. You will be evaluated under the following heads:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Participation (20%): The expectation is that you will attend lectures regularly (and on time), pay attention to what is being taught, and ask pertinent questions. Before coming to class you should study the things covered in the last few lectures. Paper presentations &ndash; everyone should read the papers and not just the presenters. During paper presentations, you should ask reasonable questions based on the paper.</li>\n\t<li>Homeworks and Class Tests (40%): While teaching, I will at times skip some of the mathsy details and simply present the results. It is your job to do all the math/ derivations/ diagrams and convince yourself of the results. Sometimes I will assign these &ldquo;filler&rdquo; derivations/ math/ diagrams as your homework. Sometimes I will assign end-of-chapter questions as homework. Sometimes I will give you short, straightforward class tests based on the material taught the week before.</li>\n\t<li>Paper presentation (30%): You will select a paper from a list and present it in&nbsp;class.</li>\n\t<li>Research Proposal (10%): 10% might not look much, but I will thoroughly and critically evaluate your proposal. A poorly done, last-minute proposal will earn an inopportune score. Also, a good research proposal distinguishes you from others.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are no midterms or final exams. However, if I do not see adequate participation and engagement from your side, I will change the evaluation criterion and you will be evaluated under the following heads: HW &amp; Class Tests (10%), Midterm (30%), Final (30%), Paper Presentation (20%), Research Proposal (10%).</p>\n </div></div>",

New Media Art that emerged in the wake of digital technology expanded the scope of artistic practice whilst being critical to the technologies it was mobilizing. Art in the time of the NFTs turned artworks into digital assets transacted predominantly through crypto and registered on a decentralized global network ledger called the blockchain. Mapping art&rsquo;s integral relationship with technology this course will unpack the diverse trajectories of video, new media, and digital art forms that disrupted the clean categories of traditional art history. Further, it will investigate the economic dimensions that accompany the proliferation of digital assets discussing whether the emergence of the NFTs as a registering standard positioned art as an alibi to normalize crypto as a global tender.</p>\n\n<p>The course begins by discussing the history of video art, from the early experiments of Nam June Paik to the immersive installations of Bill Viola, including seminal instances such as the Vision Exchange Workshop that led pioneering Indian artists Akbar Padamsee and Nalini Malani to explore the potentiality of video and animation. Drawing from the work of Ravi Sundaram, it will also discuss the proliferation of video and mobile phone technology across the Global South and how it transformed cultural production and consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course will also map the artistic responses to the internet &amp; digital surveillance technology through the practices of Antoni Muntadas, Jodi Brothers, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Trevor Paglen, CAMP (Mumbai), Hito Steyerl, Shilpa Gupta, Raqs Media Collective, and others. Further, it will introduce students to contemporary art practices driven by artificial intelligence including Refik Anadol, Entangled Others Studio, and Pindar Var Arman.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Followed by a detailed analysis of the seminal practices in the history of technology and art, the course also critically engages with the economic and ecological implications of NFTs on contemporary art.</p>\n\n<p>Course Modules: Each session of the course will include a theoretical component and a practical component, which will familiarize the students with the history of technology and art as well as, facilitate hands-on engagement with the digital artworks.</p>\n\n<p>Early Video History: A comprehensive history of video art from the 1960s-70s with reference to works of Nam June Paik, Valie Export, Vito Acconci, Joan Jonas, and Vision Exchange Workshop (1969 -72) led by Akbar Padamsee with Gieve Patel, Nalini Malani, Udayan Patel, Mani Kaul and Kumar Shahani.</p>\n\n<p>Informal Infrastructures: Mapping the late 1970s and 80s history of audio and video media circulation in the Global South through channels of informal networks of local television operators, video libraries, and theatres.</p>\n\n<p>Video and New Media Art India: Discusses the specific trajectories of video and new media art in India through the works of Baiju Parthan, Sonia Khurana, Nalini Malani, Ranbir Kaleka, Navjot Altaf, Shilpa Gupta, Raqs Media Collective, and BV Suresh.</p>\n\n<p>Novelty: By revisiting the seminal text The Language of New Media by Lev Manovich, this module introduces how the idea of newness and novelty shifted in the history of technology and art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Democracy: Discusses how the idea of access to the arts changed from the Open Source conversations in the wake of the internet to the contemporary decentralized blockchain network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Media Ecologies: &nbsp;Referring to the institutional histories of Khoj International Artists Association and Sarai Media Lab, New Delhi this module discusses how media technologies and artistic research reconfigured popular perceptions of urban neighborhoods in Delhi.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Collecting and archiving: Speaks about the multiple challenges in the history of collecting and archiving technology-based art due to their obsolescence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Aesthetics: Focuses on the diverse aesthetic trajectories of digital art history with a specific emphasis on immersion and interactivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Spectatorial Behaviors: With examples from global digital art institutions and exhibitions in the past few decades, this module maps the changes in the spectatorial behaviors of art led by technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Curating New Media Art: A module on the potentials and challenges of curating New Media art drawing from the longstanding research and work of Sarah Cook and Beryl Graham.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>NFTs and Contemporary Art: Discusses the economic and political reasons behind the massive proliferation of Non-fungible Tokens in contemporary art and the acknowledgment of non-human entity ERC-721 as the most powerful by the Art Review magazine in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>NFTs and Environment: This module discusses the comparatively less spoken environmental impact of minting NFTs. It also speaks about artists and technology activists embracing alternative forms of &lsquo;green NFTs&rsquo; that are ecologically sustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the art or the money?: This module will discuss whether art registered as NFTs became an alibi through which crypto entered the mainstream in different parts of the world.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of this course, students:</p>\n\n<p>Will be well versed in the diverse histories of technology and art.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Will develop an understanding of art forms such as Video art, New Media art, AI art, and contemporary digital art in the NFT space. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Will develop a critical understanding of NFTs and their political and ecological impact.</p>\n\n<p>Will learn the process of ideating, planning, and executing an art exhibition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Christiane, Paul.

In these times visual storytelling is making a strong space for itself in every form of information or content. Be it journalism, health information, economics or plain fiction, the visual approach is now here to stay, in an age where the best of storytelling, poetry, journalism or reportage are now visually led.</p>\n\n<p>Visual Storytelling is an ever-evolving medium. From the cave drawings documenting the hunter&rsquo;s life or the Egyptian clay tablets that documented the Pharaoh&rsquo;s philosophy or the Persian miniatures that visually documented the Ruler&rsquo;s court or the wars, the Pahadi miniatures that visually articulated the leelas of Radha Krishna to the visual documentation in the modern era, from the peasant sketches of Van Gogh, the daily life depicted by Seurat, Degas and more or the nightlife by Lautrec, the Mexican muralists like Deigo Rivera, Orzoco, Chittoprasad, Indian artists like Ram Kinkar Baij, Somenath Hore to the best graphic narratives of our times by Chris Ware, Satrapi, Joe Sacco and now to the world of You Tube and Tik Tok animations the form has only grown both in terms of practice but also viewership and acceptance. In the visual world we live now, it is a form with a moving language now blending with technology. This course will blend these influences into ones&rsquo; own practice to create comics and graphic narratives in sync with the practitioner&rsquo;s area of interest and discipline.</p>\n\n<p>This is not to say that all human centric works of art can be categorized as narrative artworks but graphic narratives have grown and imbibed many of these experiences in the making of graphic stories including films and popular culture. For a medium as absorbent as graphic storytelling, the form has drawn inspiration and acknowledged the same from multiple disciplines like painting, prose and poetry, filmmaking and even gaming. It&rsquo;s this multi-disciplinary influence and framework this course seeks to work with.</p>\n\n<p>Graphic narratives can never be limited to a category but more than a form it has evolved to a medium that has embraced every subject which makes it a complete storytelling tool than an only entertainment or an informational one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course seeks to engage with this fast-moving genre of visual storytelling through comics and graphic narratives with a research led and inter-disciplinary approach, in sync with the student&rsquo;s core area of interest or discipline.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What this course is about</strong></p>\n\n<p>In sync with the time&rsquo;s media or information dissemination, it is important to learn and practice visual storytelling as both a language and a medium that can be incorporated in one&rsquo;s individual academic discipline. This approach can help the students in articulating their learnings, research and storytelling in multi-disciplinary formats that is much required in today&rsquo;s realm of information &amp; content, where visual storytelling is an alternate and a popular form of information, opinion and communication.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The semester will be a sequential flow from the history of visual documentation and articulation to the modern practices of graphic novels, mobile cartoons, comic strips and now visual narratives on the mobile to a practice- based approach.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In the fast-moving visual world, students will learn to negotiate between the visuals and the written word in the process of crafting their individual narratives. The students will also explore and practice the modes and methods of visual storytelling through their chosen styles and influences. The expected outcome for the students will be practice based learning to develop their visual storytelling language, exploring the fluid connections between fact and fiction.</strong></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning Outcomes:</p>\n\n<p>The preliminary module of this course of 2 weeks will be a curated overview of the published, popular and the prevalent and emerging forms of visual storytelling in the world of graphic narratives and visuals. The idea would be exploring the diversity of practice across the globe and the processes involved in the making. The core idea here will be to discuss the forms and works to bring new practice-based influences and ideas, their working process and explore the architecture of visual storytelling in these works.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 1-2: Discuss works of art, graphic novels, cartoons, comic strips and create short narratives.</p>\n\n<p>This will be a presentation and discussion-based approach discussing the presented works in detail and the stories behind making many of these works. The idea will be to discuss the journey of the works from the intent to execution and the struggles and transformations that make the narrative in the final output. For example, Van Gogh&rsquo;s study of the peasantry, the sketch book notes leading to the potato eaters or Somenath Hore&rsquo;s diaries documenting the Tebhaga movement or Marjane Satrapi&rsquo;s background story behind the making of Persepolis or Chris Ware&rsquo;s documentation of the American Midwest are some of the well-articulated stories in the making of these works.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 3-5: Ideate, research, explore graphic storytelling ideas and create micro books, zines etc.</p>\n\n<p>This will be followed by 3 weeks to ideate, research, explore ideas of student&rsquo;s interest in their areas of discipline followed by field work, data collection and research on the ground. This will include visual data collection, interviews, recording, documentation and conceptualizing the idea based on the research.</p>\n\n<p>This will lead to create micro books, zines etc.</p>\n\n<p>Documentation of the research will be followed to process and distill the findings to create the core conceptual idea and be presented in the studio sessions for the benefit of collective brainstorming and discussions. These discussions with fellow classmates will led to an inter-disciplinary ideation and conceptualization, moving closer to shape and sharpen the core project ideas of the students. The students will also be expected to share the processing of their research findings along with their influences and inspirations.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 6-7: Exploring possibilities of form, conceptualization, layout, architecture etc. and presentation of a final project idea followed by discussion on similar ideas &amp; influences</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from research the course will discuss the working process of creating a visual narrative using multiple influences of form and genres. This will include detailed discussions on the various possibilities of the form i.e. different forms that can be explored -doodle narratives, popular comics, mobile based narratives, photo comics, design, layouts, page architecture, typography, sequential storytelling and the work process involved in each, enabling the students to make informed choices in sync with their ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Week 8: Presentation of a final project idea followed by discussion on similar ideas &amp; influences</p>\n\n<p>The following week the students will be expected to present their ideas and preliminary drafts as scribbles/ sketches with fellow batchmates, followed by open discussions, suggestions and ideation to evolve a clear understanding to flesh out the final narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Each student/ project will be further exposed to similar works through display and in-depth discussions on influences and ideas related to the project to lend a visual and storytelling perspective, enabling the practitioner to take one&rsquo;s work further.</p>\n\n<p>Besides creating multiple micro narratives through the semester, finally, the semester will move to its last weeks to create a bigger multi-page graphic narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 9-14: Final completion with a mid-level presentation in week 11.</p>\n\n<p>A mid-level draft presentation will be shared in the studio to display the work in progress after 2 weeks then followed by the final 4 weeks or the end of the semester, ready for display, presentation and production. Studio presence in these weeks will be a must.</p>\n\n<p>Output Participation:</p>\n\n<p>Though the output will be individual, the process of production will be based on field research, short studio collaborations and conversations and work-in-progress presentations at regular intervals as discussed above.</p>\n\n<p>Course Deliverables: Every student will be expected to develop, produce multiple research-based short visual stories and graphic narratives/ comics.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prerequisites: Narrative based research, writing, basic drawing/ doodling, basic research photography, basic mobile photography.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Reading List:</p>\n\n<p>Understanding Comics / Scott Mcloud/ William Morrow Paperbacks; Reprint edition (27 April 1994)/ ISBN-10: &lrm;006097625X</p>\n\n<p>Graphic Novels: The definitive guide / Paul Gravett/ Harper Design: ISBN: &nbsp;0060824255</p>\n\n<p>Journalism / Joe Sacco/ Jonathan Cape (14 June 2018)/ ISBN-10: &lrm;178733130X</p>\n\n<p>Building Stories / Chris Ware/ / Jonathan Cape (4 October 2012)/ ISBN-10: &lrm;9780224078122</p>\n\n<p>Documenting Trauma in Comics / Dominic Davies/ Palgrave Macmillan; 1st ed. 2020 edition (21 May 2020)/ ISBN 3030379973</p>\n\n<p>Postcolonial Comics: Texts, Events, Identities/ Ed. by Binita Mehta, Pia Mukherji/</p>\n\n<p>Routledge; 1st edition (4 May 2015)/ ISBN-10: 041573813X</p>\n\n<p>The Indian Graphic Novel: Nation, history and critique/ Pramod K.

People either hate them or love them, but they cannot ignore them. Fascinating, bewildering, and thought-provoking, megacities can teach us a lot of about our past, present, and the future. According to the United Nations, there were 33 megacities in 2018&mdash; cities with populations exceeding 10 million. What global, regional, national and local forces have combined over time&mdash; through history&mdash;to produce modern megacities? What explains their resilience, growth, diversity, and dynamism? How have megacities and its people coped with this unprecedented concentration of people and capital? What does it mean to live in such cities? Through this course, students will gain a strong footing into the world of historical, social scientific and humanistic scholarship on modern cities and urbanization. Furthermore, students will learn about the complicated dynamics between capitalism, modernity and cities; and will be encouraged to think about the relationship between history, the social sciences and the humanities.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p style=\"margin:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\">This is an interdisciplinary course that will introduce students to some of the most important readings and themes&nbsp;in the field of global urban studies and urban history.

Each student must submit at least 8 response papers through the semester. The best 5 papers will be entered into the final grade.</p>\n\n<p>Please note: you will not ordinarily receive feedback on your response unless there are some glaring issues that you need to fix. Late submission will not be accepted. You will be penalized for submitting less than 8 response papers. Eg. If overall you submit 7 papers you will lose 2 points, if you submit 6, then you will lose 4, if you submit 5 then you will lose 6. If you submit less then 4 you will lose 6 plus 4x1 = 10 points; if you submit 3 you will lose, 6 plus 4x2= 14 points.</p>\n\n<p>Tip: These are low stakes easy assignments. Be sure to max this.</p>\n\n<p>Annotated Bibliography&mdash; 20 per cent: Choose a city you will focus on by Sept 30. You will be required to enter your choice in a google sheet that your TPA will provide. You will then prepare an annotated bibliography on the city you are studying. An annotated bibliography consists of a list of readings&mdash;properly cited (Chicago Style)&mdash;and with a short, paragraph-long abstract. In your case, the bibliography will mainly consist of secondary scholarship on the city you are focusing on. Popular literary sources, newspaper reports, and other audio-visual sources such as movies will be welcome. I expect every annotated bibliography to have at least 10 and not more than 15 entries. You must cover at least 5 themes that we will discuss from the month from mid term onwards.</p>\n\n<p>Tip: If you keep up with weekly readings and attempt to relate it to the city you have chosen to study from the beginning, preparing an annotated bibliography will not involve any extra time. You will have a detailed annotated bibliography by the end of the course if you maintain a log and a summary (written in your own words) of the readings you did on your own.</p>\n\n<p>Deadline: Nov 30. Late submission will not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Group Presentation&mdash; 20 per cent:&nbsp; Students will be divided into groups: Each group will highlight the broad similarities and dissimilarities between the various cities that members of their groups have studied. We will dedicate the last day of the class to presentations.</p>\n\n<p>Example: suppose we have a group of 4 students&mdash;student 1 picked New Delhi, student 2 picked Karachi, student 3 picked Beijing and student 4 picked Bangkok. They will have to come together and highlight broad patterns of similarity and dissimilarities among these cities, using at least three themes discussed in class.</p>\n\n<p>Tip: Your annotated bibliography will come in extremely handy for your group presentation.</p>\n\n<p>Term end paper 30 per cent: Write a 1000- 1200 words reflection on the question: What good is urban history? Please base your answer on your readings throughout the course.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I am not looking for a &ldquo;correct answer.&rdquo; I am looking for a well-argued answer.</p>\n\n<p>Tip: The course is organized around this question. If you keep this question in mind and jot down your thoughts in a document throughout the course systematically, you will have no problem in writing your reflection.</p>\n\n<p>Deadline: Dec 10.</p>\n\n<p>You will lose 1 grade per day of delay. So for one day delay a final overall grade of A- will become B+; for 2 days delay, final overall grade of A- will become B&hellip;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Unexplained absence will be penalized.

Is Buddhism non-violent? Then how do we interpret the role of monks in violent identity politics and aggressive nationalisms? Was the Buddha a vegetarian?&nbsp; If not, how does vegetarianism enter into Buddhist environmentalist discourse? Do Buddhist ethics prescribe egalitarianism and inclusion? Then how do gender inequalities persist in Buddhist institutions and practices? Are monasteries spaces for meditation and prayers? Then how are they co-opted into electoral battles? Is&nbsp;Buddhism not&nbsp;about renunciation? Then what do we make of the relations between Buddhism and business?</p>\n\n<p>This course will provide a critical understanding of contemporary Buddhism.

As India celebrates the 75th year of its independence, what are the successes and failures of the Indian state? Why do the successes and failures seem paradoxical when juxtaposed next to each other? Have rapid technological advancements fundamentally altered how the Indian state works? What are possible ways in which the state functioning can be strengthened? The course will rely on a comparative perspective to examine these questions. Throughout the semester, we will explore various dimensions of the Indian state while also comparing India&rsquo;s performance with other countries such as USA, China, Brazil, and Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course is broadly divided into two parts &ndash; the first part (first five weeks) will introduce students to the major theoretical frameworks used to understand the functioning of the state. We will begin by looking at a range of dominant theoretical paradigms like the principal-agent framework and the state-society framework to understand how politicians or social groups influence the functioning of the state apparatus. The second part will delve into empirical papers and exploration of quantitative metrics on state performance. The theoretical frameworks discussed in the first part will keep reappearing as the course shifts to specific case studies, empirical papers, and analysis of publicly available datasets.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the second part of the course, students will read more empirically oriented papers that explore different facets of the workings of the state. The students will also look at national, cross- national, and sub-national datasets 1 &nbsp;to test out the theories. Each week will touch upon a specific area of state functioning like regulating urbanization, providing basic education, delivery of welfare services, etc.&nbsp;The course will involve multiple group projects as well as an individually written final research paper.</p>\n</div></div>",

Should we think of power as &quot;means&quot; or an &quot;end&quot;? This course aims to bring together classic and contemporary work on power elites (political, economic and other such spheres) to understand their role in shaping Indian Democracy as we see it today. Power elites in short are an intricate node of influencers that shapes decision-making in any society at any given point of time. As Pareto reminded us a long time ago that while the nodes of influence may remain the same, individuals who occupy these positions change (ala. circulation of elites). We will make an attempt to understand how power is created, shared, transferred and disrupted. The course covers a range of important topics within the study of elites. First, we will review key theoretical contributions concerning power elites. We will focus on political ambition, examine why people aspire for political office, recruitment process and others. Second, we will also learn about other key sectors such as economic/ business elites, social/ cultural elites, among others to get an overview of the processes that determine the composition of decision-making circles. Third, with the available evidence (and case studies), we hope to develop an understanding of the forces shaping elite behavior and how that in turn is shaping Indian democracy.<br />\n<br />\nPre-requisites: Introduction to Indian Politics (1004) OR a similar course in Sociology and Anthropology.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The final grades in the course will be based on a continuous assessment system, i.e., participation in the class including attendance (15%), in-class presentation (20%), a short memo (20%), and a final paper (45%).

Who counts as Chinese? What is China&rsquo;s place in the modern world? Can China only be understood on Chinese terms? These questions have been&nbsp;continuously debated both inside and outside China, with more and more urgency. We will read works by historians, anthropologists, political scientists, sociologists, economists, and other &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and commentators to explore how these questions have been answered, who has answered them, and who is allowed to ask them. On the one hand, these questions can be seen as partially representative of China&rsquo;s social, economic, cultural and intellectual transformation from an empire to a nation-state. On the other hand, and just as importantly, these questions can be seen as partially representative of the global transformations that intersected with and helped shape the direction of China&rsquo;s changes, just as China firmly integrated itself into global systems and its dominant logics of knowledge production and social formations.</p>\n\n<p>This class will take a historiographical and conceptual approach to the study of these questions. Structured around the discussion of three major themes, namely, history, culture, and philosophy, we will examine what the study of China has meant for different kinds of audiences, and how those perspectives have evolved across time and disciplines. Therefore, we will also pay special attention to how &ldquo;China&rdquo; has been explained to academic and popular audiences by non-Chinese commentators. As a deeply heterogenous cultural formation that has transformed and been transformed by other cultures and systems, we will consider what is distinctive, or not, about the study of &ldquo;China&rdquo; in our time and our region.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Think critically about the concept of &lsquo;China&rsquo; in long-term historical perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to identify multiple alternative sources through which to learn about China, and analyse their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p>Identify common tropes in written and visual primary source material related to China.</p>\n\n<p>Analyse the arguments and sources used by scholars in different disciplines writing about China.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are not required to purchase any materials for this course.

If you have circumstances that might affect attendance at a specific class meeting, please let me know ahead of time whenever possible. Flexibility is especially important since Covid is still with us. To protect your privacy, please do not describe any medical situations to me; just inform me that the situation exists and be prepared to provide a doctor&rsquo;s note if requested.</p>\n\n<p>Participation is part of your grade, and should be based on attentive reading, listening, and preparation.

Armed Conflicts in India [POL-2091] [POL-2091-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Kaustav Dhar Chakrabarti [kaustav.chakrabarti@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&ldquo;One person&rsquo;s freedom fighter is another person&rsquo;s terrorist&rdquo; is a common expression that sums up the complexity of armed conflicts around the world. How should we understand the state&rsquo;s claims to legitimacy versus some of our most cherished beliefs in civil rights and the right to self-determination? This course will approach the question through the lens of theories in political science while being grounded in the empirical realities of armed conflicts across India. The course does not take a normative position on these conflicts &ndash; we will not assume that armed groups are &lsquo;unlawful&rsquo;, neither will we valorise them. We will treat armed conflicts as a political phenomenon of interest, and I invite you to use the course to sharpen and test your prior views.</p>\n\n<p>The course will cover five major themes on armed conflicts. We will begin with establishing a solid conceptual foundation &ndash; What are armed conflicts? How are they different from other forms of organized violence? What are armed groups? Next, we will examine the causes of armed conflicts. Are conflicts rooted in political and economic grievances? Or should we blame self-interested leaders?</p>\n\n<p>In the second module, we will study how combat, or war-fighting differs between civil wars and conventional interstate war. We will explore how armed groups organize for war (the lessons of Mao, Irish Republican Army) and how India responds and read counterinsurgency doctrine and examine the effect of &lsquo;hearts and minds&rsquo; development programs. The third module covers arguably the core of guerrilla warfare &ndash; armed groups&rsquo; relations with the community. We will examine how armed groups mobilize support, the depth of their connections with the community and their treatment of civilians, and the methods that they adopt to solicit the community&rsquo;s support. We will also cover the terrain of pre-existing social institutions and the community&rsquo;s experience with the incumbent state and examine how it affects its decision to support (or withhold support) to armed groups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The fourth modules returns to aspects of armed groups where we will study how commitment to ideology, and robust centralized organization to ensure discipline among cadre, and splintering into factions,&nbsp; affects the behaviour of armed groups.</p>\n\n<p>The final module covers the role of external factors &ndash; foreign bases in inaccessible forests of Myanmar, support from China and Pakistan, the role of diaspora, and ask if the presence of &lsquo;foreign fighters&rsquo; should change our understanding. The course culminates with the important theme of conflict resolution; why did military methods succeed in Punjab but not in Kashmir? Why did negotiations succeed in Mizoram but have failed to resolve the dispute in Nagaland?&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goals of the course are three-fold. By the end of the course, students should have an overview of some of the major debates in the political science of civil war, especially those that are pertinent to India. In addition, the course will familiarise students with major civil wars (or &lsquo;insurgencies&rsquo;) in India through detailed case studies. Finally, the course will reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form. &nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please refer to readings from the previous iteration of the course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Class 1: Introductions, Greetings, Review of Syllabus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Reading and Writing Resources (optional)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Humphreys, Macartan.

Why are civil wars so violent toward civilians? We read the seminal Logic of Violence in Civil Wars by Kalyvas. The book&#39;s theory itself is divided into four chapters. I have curated sections from different works of Kalyvas to provide a full account in around 40 pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Kalyvas, Stathis N. 2006. The Logic of Violence in Civil War.

Pages 405-414&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lynn, John A. 2005. &ldquo;Patterns of Insurgency and Counterinsurgency.&rdquo; MILITARY REVIEW, 6.

Start with Kalyvas 2012 (pages 660-661, section &quot;The Control Collaboration Model&quot;). This is a one page summary of the argument.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2. Read Kalyvas 2006 (pages 89-106, section 4.2 to 4.4). This identifies the problem of separating armed groups from ordinary civilians and explains how the community&#39;s compliance is generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3. Read Kalyvas 2008 (pages 405-414, begin reading from the sub-title &quot;Omitted Variable Bias&quot;). This is a longer summary of the theory of selective violence. It will familiarise you with the argument that the threat of violence produces community&#39;s collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4. Read Kalyvas 2006; (pages 118-132, section 5.3 and 5.4). This adds more detail to the previous reading.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Put together, the four readings will give you a sufficient picture of Kalyvas&#39;s argument that is otherwise spread over 100 pages in the book. Don&#39;t think about organizing the readings or think about how they speak to each other. Instead, think about the four readings as different accounts of the same argument.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In addition, supplement Kalyvas with two perspectives from military practitioners. If you are really pressed for time, you can skip these, but I urge you to read them, since it&#39;ll enhance your understanding of how guerrilla wars are fought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lynn 2005 (pages 22-25, section &quot;Basic Model of Insurgency/Counterinsurgency&quot;). Ask yourself - is Kalyvas saying the same thing with more bells and whistles?</p>\n\n<p>Kilcullen 2005. (pages 604-606, section &quot;competing paradigms - Terrorism and Insurgency).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Class 8: Counterinsurgency Doctrine&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Canon of Western (and Indian)- Counterinsurgency Doctrine. We will compare Kalyvas&rsquo;s &lsquo;logic of violence&rsquo; with case studies of how India and the United States understand the nature of civil war and the way to respond to the threat. Two declassified doctrines of the US and Indian military provide an opportunity to carry out this comparison.

On the other hand, COIN doctrines espouse restraint and call for winning &lsquo;hearts and minds&rsquo;. We extend our understanding of the motivation of armed actors and the consequences of coercion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lyall, Jason, Graeme Blair, and Koseuke Imai. 2013. &ldquo;Explaining Support for Combatants during Wartime: A Survey Experiment in Afghanistan.&rdquo; American Political Science Review 107 (04): 679&ndash;705.</p>\n\n<p>Sambanis, N., J.

[repeat reading, revise your notes from the Mizoram reading]</p>\n\n<p>The readings are more voluminous than I could have liked, but many sections can be skimmed, and the time that it takes to read will be less than the number of pages would otherwise suggest. Jelle Wouters is one of my favourite writers and a role model for beautiful prose. He shows two faces of the state in Nagaland - one that is coercive and the other that is developmental. Skim his engagement with anthropology theory and read for content that shows the state&rsquo;s two dimensions. Follow it with a chapter from my dissertation (pages 6-34, begin from &lsquo;Summary of Evidence&rsquo; and read till end of Section 3). The chapter shows how factional conflict is different from state-armed group conflict. Case studies of Dimapur and Kohima also show both &lsquo;tribalism&rsquo; at play and armed group-community ties. Skim the sections on governance and focus on factional conflict and armed group-community ties. Revise your notes for the Sundar article that you have read for Mizoram.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Class 20: Mizoram&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mizoram is a remarkable case study of both war and peace, which makes its relative absence in scholarly debates all the more perplexing.</p>\n\n<p>Pachuau, Joy L.

Prof Pachuau who teaches at JNU and is herself from Mizoram presents a history of Mizo society through photographs. This chapter will &lsquo;show&rsquo; details of civil war. Follow it by reading Nandini Sundar&rsquo;s oral history of civil war in both Mizoram and Nagaland, where she focuses on the strategy of grouping, or forced displacement of village communities into internment camps.</p>\n\n<p>Two accompanying articles provide primary source evidence. Read Jafa&rsquo;s (another IAS officer who continues to be hugely admired, as I found out, in Mizoram) recollection of a candid conversation with a military officer who questioned the morality of his actions (pages 10-12, start with the highlighted part). Do not miss selections from a memoir of Lalrawnliana, a former commander of the Mizo Army that captures vivid details of guerrilla warfare and the role of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Class 21: Assam&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Baruah, Sanjib. 2005.

See selections below&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Human Rights Watch report is extensive and voluminous. To keep the reading manageable, read the summary and key recommendations (pages 1-11). Then move to Section V and Section VI. The two sections provide a glimpse into the nature of violence carried out by state and armed groups. We will try to compare them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;In Section V, read the introduction to the section, and introduction to sub-parts A, B, C and D. In each sub-part, read a couple of examples.

Follow it with contrasting case studies of military approaches to conflict termination in Punjab (Mahadevan, read only the Conclusion) and political negotiations in Mizoram (Jafa, read the last section &lsquo;Towards Peace and Settlement&rsquo;). Note that both case studies are drawn from South Asia Terrorism Portal, which has a reputation of celebrating militaristic strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Class 25: + Wrap-up&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>No readings!!</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course will not grade on a scale.

The course will introduce students to the Chinese language and culture and focus on basic speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. This includes an introduction to phonetics, basic vocabulary, and expressions of daily use. The course will prepare the students to attain a certain level of understanding and proficiency in Chinese language through interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational modes.

What forces&mdash;personal, interpersonal, or collective and communal&mdash;regulate, prescribe and even prohibit experiences and expressions of love. To paraphrase the narrator of The God of Small Things, this course attempts reflections on the &ldquo;Love Laws&rdquo; that determine who can be loved, how and how much.</p>\n\n<p>The texts chosen for our study have been selected from literature, cinema, and television. In their own unique ways, each text deals with such themes through representations of experiences from subject positions that lie outside of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;normative&rdquo; structures within which love and care are usually understood and experienced. The primary objective of the course then is to develop a critical language towards understanding and addressing care and love as the basis for a relationship with oneself and between oneself and others.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Presentations: 10%</p>\n\n<p>Journaling: 20%</p>\n\n<p>Midterm: 15%</p>\n\n<p>Attendance and Participation: 25%</p>\n\n<p>Final: 30%</p>\n </div></div>",

Our new world has new rules: intellectual property looks different, cyber-crime looms large, cold cyber-warfare persists at a nation-state level, planet-scale surveillance is commonplace, we&#39;re all about to lose our jobs to robots, and the list goes on.<br />\n<br />\nWe shall study the rise of fake news and nation-state propaganda, the nature of sensitive information and the importance of privacy, and the deeper structural issues (such as the nature of the internet, the laws of scale, and the direction of technological progress, especially in AI) that underlie many of our problems. We will also spend significant time understanding how these issues affect our political processes (and how personal autonomy and &quot;consent&quot; are affected). Some background in graph theory will be helpful (though not required).<br />\n<br />\nWhile this course shall be interesting for computer science experts and non-experts alike, we&rsquo;ll hold extra sessions for non-expert students: you should be willing to get their hands dirty! Students will also be expected to do some background reading on the history of the internet, cyber-crime, etc.<br />\n<br />\nNote that this will be a HARD course (I will be teaching at a graduate level), and you will be dealing with ill-defined real-world problems with missing information.<br />\n<br />\nThe syllabus is broken into five &quot;theses&quot;:<br />\n1. Resources: Humans, Money, and Material (includes data)<br />\n2. Control: &nbsp; Propaganda, Surveillance, Crimes, War<br />\n3. Flow: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Structure of the Internet and Sensitive Information<br />\n4. Delusion: &nbsp;Presence is Power. Understanding cultural heritage and identity.<br />\n5. Robots: &nbsp; &nbsp;Is AI going to take over the world?<br />\n<br />\nWe will be looking at all of these topics through a technical lens, and it is expected that students will use their own backgrounds and experiences to enrich these conversations. Think about how you might add to the discussion if we discuss how China is using AI in Xinjiang (or the COMPAS system used for bail applications in NY).</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You should have a more nuanced, wider, and deeper understanding of the interplay between computing and human society and its many facets, from the economics and supply chains involved, to elections and propaganda, to individual-level behavioral changes.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>List of Readings (you&#39;ll be assigned specific chapters, but many end up reading the whole thing; I will provide access to books).

What is specifically South Asian about South Asian Art? What does it mean to think of South Asia and Art as analytical categories? Did South Asian Art always exist? Or were historical processes involved in the making of the field? Where do we locate the &ldquo;genesis&rdquo; of art in South Asia? Did art forms in South Asia emerge in a zone of cultural and social isolation? Or can we trace trajectories of trans-regional contacts, encounters, and exchanges as central to the shaping of the field of South Asian Art? What is space of tradition and innovation in the visual arts of South Asia? Did arts of South Asia &ldquo;influence&rdquo; artistic practices in other regions? How did artists at different points in history think about the region we identify as South Asia? Seeking to address some of these questions, this course examines aspects of the visual arts of South Asia from its earliest traces in cave paintings and stone implements to sculpture, painting, illustrated manuscripts, calligraphy, and architecture. The course follows a chronological scale, from pre-history to c. 1980s.</p>\n\n<p>The vast geographical as well as the temporal span of the field will restrict the course from delivering an encyclopaedic survey. The course will prioritize intensive analysis of selected themes. Rather than placing the teleology of South Asian &ldquo;art&rdquo; solely in the context of changing dynastic histories, the course takes up specific themes in art across a range of objects, artefacts, archaeological sites, built spaces, religious and political symbols, and institutions of art pedagogy and exhibitions. In the process we address the questions of image, icon, and representations of body, portraiture, architectural forms, landscape, in the context of social and ideological changes, aesthetic turns, shifting patrons and markets, and introduction of new material media. The course will probe both &lsquo;South Asia&rsquo; and &lsquo;South Asian Art&rsquo; as stable (art) historical categories and map the new methodologies and vocabularies employed by art historians.</p>\n\n<p>Class discussions will form the basis for (compulsory) museum,&nbsp;gallery, and site classes to the National Museum of India (New Delhi, contingent on the continutity of the existing institution, physical classes), NGMA (New Delhi, physical classes), Delhi Art Gallery (Delhi,&nbsp;physical classes),&nbsp;National Handloom and Handicrafts Museum (New Delhi, physical classes), Indian Museum, Kolkata (Virtual), British Museum (Virtual), Victoria and Albert Museum (Virtual) and the MET (Virtual) which will enable us to study the works of art in their institutional locations and explore the visual dynamics of organization of exhibition spaces.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>On successful completion of the course, we will be able to:</p>\n\n<p>a) Identify and analyze aspects of works of art and visual images in different material and medium using appropriate vocabulary</p>\n\n<p>b) Explore the main trends in the development of Art History and Visual Culture by accessing the critical essential skills</p>\n\n<p>c) Evaluate the approaches of artists, art historians, visual anthropologists and curators to the field of visual arts</p>\n\n<p>d) Develop the interests for a future training in critical art historical training and art curatorial programmes</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>None.</p>\n\n<p>No prior training in Visual Arts or Art History required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course is a gateway (core) course in Visual Arts Minor/ Concentration programme.

Students will be assessed on basis on their active engagement with course contents during classes and after class office hours which will carry ten percent (10%) of the total course grades.</p>\n\n<p>2. Museum,&nbsp;gallery and site classes and image analysis will carry thirty percent (30%) of the total course grades. The subsequent submission of a written report on an object/ image of your choice (within a word limit of 700 to 900 words) counts for 30% of the total course grades.</p>\n\n<p>3. The mid semester assessment will comprise of a class presentation based on any one image chosen by the student in discussion with the instructor. The mid semester evaluation will carry twenty percent (20%) of the total course grades.</p>\n\n<p>4. For the end semester evaluation we will write an essay between 2000 and 2500 words (including footnotes and bibliography). The topic of the end semester assessment has to be chosen by the student from a range of verbal text and visual image prompts provided by the course instructor. The end semester assessments for this course will follow a feed forward method and students are actively encouraged to submit (within date and time specified) one working draft/ draft in progress to the course instructor for comments and feedback. The end semester assessment will carry forty percent (40%) of the total course grades.</p>\n\n<p>5. Audit students have to give and actively participate in classes (both on campus and museum, gallery, and site classes).

The second section provides an overview of the various theoretical frameworks that have come to define the field. The last section of the course concerns the future of the discipline highlighting someof the pertinent debates and questions to be addressed by the discipline. The overall objective of the course is to give students a broad grounding in the wide theoretical terrain of the field and to sensitize students to differences in thenature of knowledge claims (epistemology) and fundamental assumptions about social/international reality (ontology)as well as political and ethical implications of different theoretical approaches in IR.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There are four components of grading- which is based on&nbsp;continuous assessment throughout the semester.</p>\n\n<p>A) Attendance and Class participation (15%)<br />\nB) Midterm Assessment: In Class Examination (30%)&nbsp;<br />\nC) Reflections on Theory (15%)&nbsp;<br />\nD) End Semester Essay (40%)&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div>",

Foreign policy analysis is granular for it examines how policy-makers decide. As you will learn, actual decision-making is always messier than what grand theories imply. So, from the grand and the &lsquo;macro&rsquo;, we look on the domestic, state, organizational, and personal levels to understand the multitude of factors that affect a country&rsquo;s foreign policy. In order to do this, we make use of various conceptual lenses: theories of rational choice, individual/group psychology, emotions, culture/identity, and political economy. In other words, this course will be an exercise in unlearning IR Theory 101.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the kind of questions that this class will help you think through? Perhaps questions such as &lsquo;How did Nehru&rsquo;s experience of colonial subjugation shape his ideas of non-alignment?&rsquo;, Why did the US armed forces support the blockade option during the Cuban Missile Crisis?, &nbsp;&lsquo;How does the Pakistan Army&rsquo;s organizational culture affect the country&rsquo;s attitude towards India?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Does the shale-lobby affect Canada&rsquo;s international commitments towards global warming?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Does race impact EU&rsquo;s refugee policy?&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>Now the brass tacks &ndash; this is a core course and it will have an exam component (see below). In addition, you will also be required to submit one-page (500 words) weekly memos in which you are required to engage with the readings of that week. The tone of these may not be necessarily &lsquo;academic&rsquo; &ndash; it can be conversational, reflective, or humorous. However, you will be expected to analyze, critique, and go beyond the text. What a memo WILL NOT BE is a summary of the readings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Also, an plagiarism (including ChatGPT) will result in an immediate FAIL. No exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>Assessment Methods</p>\n\n<p>The course includes both continuous and cumulative forms of assessment.</p>\n\n<p>For continuous assessment, the students are required to submit six 500-word memos during the course of the entire semester (as per their choice of weeks). The aim of the memo is to make sure students both read and critically analyze the readings</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there will be a mid-semester examination in which students will be tested on the fundamentals of foreign policy analysis&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the semester, students will have to write a 2500 word essay, the prompts for which will be provided beforehand. Students will have to choose one of the prompts for the end-semester essay</p>\n\n<p>Participation in the class and the discussion sessions (run by a Teaching fellow) will also constitute a part of the grade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Grading Weightage</p>\n\n<p>Memos: 20%</p>\n\n<p>Mid Term Exam: 30%</p>\n\n<p>End Semester Essay: 30%</p>\n\n<p>Participation and Attendance: 20%</p>\n</div></div>",

Today&rsquo;s strongmen, such as Trump, Modi, and Orb&aacute;n, demonstrate the rising popularity of populist leadership around the world. This has resulted in a significant rise in the number of scholars studying populism in the recent years, and it is now considered as one of the most contentious issues in contemporary political science. Whether it is the rise and popularity of right-wing nationalism in countries such as India, Israel, Italy or&nbsp;Turkey, or the&nbsp;turn to &quot;democratic authoritarianism&quot; in several constitutional democracies in the world today, or the role of social media as decisive in electoral politics in linking the leader to the masses, populism is seen as a central concept to understand all these contemporary challenges. In order to understand the concept and the political practice of populism, we not only need to examine it both in contemporary times and in history, but also the different forms it has assumed in societies as diverse as Hungary, India, the UK, the Philippines, Brazil, Turkey, the United States of America etc. These varied experiences with populism have also resulted in a diversity of approaches to study this phenomenon. This course will introduce students to influential theories of populism as well as empirical experiences of populism in countries such as India, the United States of America, as well as countries in Latin America and Europe. Analysing populism in various countries will help ground theoretical discussions to the empirical realities of populist politics.</p>\n\n<p>The syllabus is divided in two parts: in Part &ndash; I we will study the key approaches and theoretical debates on populism; in Part &ndash; II we will study specific case-studies of populism by focussing on countries with a long history and/or recent experience of populism. Throughout the semester, students will be familiarized with the key approaches and theoretical debates on populism, as well as its empirical manifestations in various countries, all the while tracing the conceptual changes and challenges to this concept in its relation to democracy, nationalism and media. For this course please be prepared to read approx. 50-100 pages per week.</p>\n</div></div>",

Finally, we will evaluate the role of access to technology, and how decision making structures within military and governmental institutions serve as the means to contain or to further proliferate war.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

Blogging and&nbsp;social media websites have&nbsp;accelerated the velocity of information production and sharing, unlike earlier times, when information production was primarily the monopoly of mass media houses. The lines have indeed blurred between&nbsp;news producers, curators, and commentators. In this course, we will take&nbsp;a multi-layered approach to make sense of the changing media landscape&nbsp;and its implications. Some topics we will study, include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Political bias in mass media vs. social media. Does social media accentuate the biases in mass media, or does it act as an active space for debate/bias mitigation.</li>\n\t<li>Interaction between mass media and social media. Is social media a distribution channel for mass media, or a&nbsp;curation and commentary channel?</li>\n\t<li>Modeling of information flow on mass media and social media. What kind of information flows where and when in the network? Can information flows&nbsp;be artificially regulated (e.g. to propagate mis-/disinformation or propaganda)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will study the&nbsp;basics of social network analysis, graph&nbsp;models, timeline analysis, tools for text analysis of content, entity&nbsp;resolution, and read multi-disciplinary papers from recent conferences&nbsp;and journals in computer science, political science, sociology, and media.&nbsp;In the latter part of the course, we will apply some of these tools and&nbsp;techniques learnt, to analyze content and networks around media. This analysis will aid us in capturing&nbsp;patterns and evolution of media bias and topical discourse, content flow in social media, and user and network characteristics around social media event communities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This will be a project based course, students will work in groups and&nbsp;implement largescale data collection and analysis systems. Extensive coding would be a part of the latter half of the&nbsp;course wherein the students will have to implement a complete pipeline as part of their project&nbsp;(starting from data collection, preprocessing/cleaning, storage, to information retrieval).</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This paper reading and project based&nbsp;course will enable research thinking among students. Needless to state, it will also introduce them to computational media analysis and its various facets (media and algorithmic&nbsp;bias detection, algorithmic methods to counter such biases, and fake news detection and analysis).&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading List: To be shared on Google Classroom</p>\n\n<p>Prerequisites:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Introduction to ML</li>\n\t<li>Data Structures</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Students not meeting the prerequisites can audit the course.

What does translation do to local understandings of caste? How do translators navigate an intercultural space while extending access to texts and voices? Apart from something being lost, what are some things that are gained in translation? We&rsquo;ll address these questions by looking at canonical and understudied texts written in Tamil and translated into English, particularly those concerning caste. Texts as wide-ranging as ancient Sangam literature and contemporary Tamil music will be a part of the course. Through the lens of translation theory, we&rsquo;ll look at how various cultural texts engage the question of caste, inequality, and aesthetics. The course pays particular attention to how writers and translators have dealt with the question of caste and gender together.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further, we&rsquo;ll examine how English interacts with Tamil as a language and worldview. Given that English as a language continues to play an important role in anti-caste politics, the course examines translation&rsquo;s and the translator&rsquo;s place in this conversation. Students will learn to appreciate the formal choices that translators make keeping the popular literary conventions of Tamil and English literature in mind, even as they pay close attention to the local context.

Taking this to be the guiding question, this course will introduce students to the role that eighteenth-century literature plays in our understanding of human rights. We will pay attention to both the colonial and anti-colonial ethos of this period to better understand the historical and cultural context in which human rights, as we recognise them today, were fashioned.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How do human rights travel across geographical boundaries, communities, and literary forms? We&rsquo;ll study different forms such as the novel, the short story, the lyric, and the slave narrative; and consider them as evolving forms in the long eighteenth century that tussle with the discourse of human rights.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students will get acquainted with how scholars of literary studies have deployed decades-long work on the category of the &lsquo;human&rsquo; to intervene in the global rise in rights discourse. If literary forms and the law are concerned with constraints, we&rsquo;ll see how human rights claims at once engage both these boundaries creatively. To this end, we&rsquo;ll read both canonical texts such as Robinson Crusoe, Equiano&rsquo;s slave narrative, and also some lesser-known texts such as Mary Robinson&rsquo;s lyrics, and Veeramamunivar&rsquo;s The Adventures of Guru Paramartha.

We&rsquo;ll explore this question through different kinds of texts from the nineteenth century, including (mainly) novels, poems, and other literary works, but also some non-fictional writings that approach the matter of matter from a scientific, ecological, or aesthetic perspective. Whereas writing belongs to the realm of the symbolic&mdash;of language, representation, and meaning&mdash;it is shaped by material realities, and&nbsp;also vividly <em>materialises</em> imagination. We understand, in other words, that literature is shaped by relations of production and of power; but &#39;material&#39; can also refer to earth, body, cloud, velvet, stone, flame, oranges, dust, gold, grease.&nbsp;As we read and think about materials, we will open text into texture, to ask whether a renewed critical vocabulary can emerge from our consideration&nbsp;-- one that is attuned to the&nbsp;relation of human and non-human;&nbsp;body and ecology; things and forces; space and affect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Victorian period perfectly allows for a&nbsp;juxtaposition of stuff and non-sense with sense and sensibility, given the contending&nbsp;nineteenth-century affinities&nbsp;for&nbsp;science and progress, for&nbsp;vital materialism and occult forces, and for&nbsp;social and psychological realism. We will read through both canonical and lesser-known works from the era (including longer texts by Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, George Eliot, and Thomas Hardy;&nbsp;poetry by Alfred&nbsp;Tennyson, Robert Browning, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and shorter works of genre fiction). Alongside, we will also dip into non-fictional archives, including works&nbsp;by Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, John Ruskin, Walter Pater, and Henry David Thoreau, as well as reading more contemporary theorists of materiality and materialism.

That is, the unclaimed histories of human experiences that tend to fall by the wayside. Given the representational limitations of the evidence-based historical discipline, working with the unconscious disrupts some well-established disciplinary protocols of historiographical practice. It requires a redefinition of the words history, truth, evidence and archive. It also raises some uncomfortable questions such as: How do we attend to the affective dimension of experience - ours and that of historical subjects? How can we subject experiential claims to rigorous investigation and disputation? How does our relationship to a remembered past, or to the past which we imagine is inaccessible to us, serve desires in the present? How do we rethink the complex relationship of narrative structures to truth claims? This course engages with these questions as it takes the students through the writings of historians who successfully adapted psychoanalytic concepts to historical analysis. The course begins with familiarizing the students with a few psychoanalytic concepts that historians tend to draw on followed by weekly segments devoted to a psychoanalytical historical work.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This is a reading-intensive seminar.

The institutionalization and professionalization of History followed in the 19th century. History as a discipline came to be conceived of as a rigorous science based on evidence. Since that time, notwithstanding the intellectual and ideological orientation of a historian, historical inquiry has been premised on gathering and interpretation of evidence. However, the postmodernist critique shook the foundational ideas of the discipline. It questioned the objectivity and stability of historical facts, the historians&rsquo; narratives and their epistemic truth. The consequent disciplinary churn led to a&nbsp; rethinking of the idea of archive and the referential paradigm of the historian&rsquo;s craft.&nbsp; This course explores the questions that came to fore in what has come to be known as the &lsquo;archival turn&rsquo; in History. These include: Is archive simply a physical repository of historical materials or an idea or a storehouse of memories and dreams? What role does power and privilege play in the creation and one&rsquo;s access to an archive?&nbsp; What distortions or accretions does time create in the archival objects? Can the archives be queered? What are the layers of narratives that an archive embodies? What does it visibilize or silence? In what way does the historian&#39;s subjectivity and desires mediate their work in the archives? How does one work with archival artifacts - against the grain or along the grain? What is the difference between an extractive and ethnographic approach to the archives? What are the ethics of working with an archive? This course engages with the conceptual writings on archives and seeks to train students in working with different kinds of archival material. The class format will be a combination of discussions on a set of thematic readings followed by a workshop with archival materials.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This is a reading-intensive seminar.

We will attempt to evaluate the extent to which each of these factors, either singly, or in combination, affected decision making on inter-state relations during the decades of the Cold War.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the course will also highlight how the progression of the Cold War decades also witnessed the making of deeper inter-connections across the globe. For example, we will consider how the distant developments of the Cold War were also of relevance in shaping India&rsquo;s position in the world. Furthermore, we will examine how the developments of the Cold War were equally shaped, not just by the superpowers, but also by smaller, poorer, and recently decolonized countries. Enabling an evaluation of why developments unfolded in the way that they did during the Cold War, therefore, the course will show how the appraisal of events from more than a single point of view, is necessary to understand the impact of the Cold War more fully on present day international politics.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will also explore the newer directions of the historiography on the Cold War, including the ways in which its debates influenced popular culture and the international perceptions of technological aid. Ultimately, we will ask, in what ways can our analysis of the Cold War help us in shaping our present day understanding of the conduct of international affairs in the present?</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/Readings on International History and grading_cec3d056-645c-48a2-8f76-1c4f9ac22f37.pdf'>Readings on International History and grading_cec3d056-645c-48a2-8f76-1c4f9ac22f37.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

One of the strongest tools in the arsenal of media professionals, sound can construct, amplify and create more dynamic narratives, while engaging subliminally, whether it is in the form of music or sound design, sound art or spoken word. This course is an audio literacy primer.</p>\n\n<p>In this course over three months, we will deconstruct sound and explore the building blocks of audio from the lens of its Nature, Behaviour and Interaction. We will break it down to its key components of physics, its interaction with space and different mediums, its translation and the listener&rsquo;s interpretation of this engagement. This will guide us through the levels of intervention that can be done in pre and post-production through Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) to construct and curate the steps in sound processing. These techniques of bending sound can be applied to all forms of sound in various media; be it podcasting, audiobooks, music production, sound design and sound art.

Both while capturing it and in post-production; to narrow the differences for more coherence and continuity in the program material.</li>\n\t<li>The students will be able to assess the merits of different microphones and make informed choices on equipment and techniques of recording.</li>\n\t<li>Get a firm grasp on navigating DAWs and be able to work with multitrack audio. They will be able to tweak multitrack audio concerning the final delivery medium.</li>\n\t<li>Engage with sound using processing tools with a focus on the sound&rsquo;s emotional contour and context. They will develop the foundation for the skills needed to ensure that the program material translates and sounds as intended across different playback systems.</li>\n\t<li>Compile in the form of an audio story / podcast (fiction or nonfiction) with stock music and SFX and render it for release with industry standard audio specs.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Attendance: 10%</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>7 Exercises: 35%</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Assignment 01: 25%&nbsp;</strong>The work will be graded on</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Workflow (5%)</strong>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>file naming after imports</li>\n\t\t<li>colour coding of the project</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Session organisation (5%)</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>consolidating files on completion</li>\n\t\t<li>maintaining&nbsp;time-machine&nbsp;backups</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Quality of balance in processing (15%)</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Spectral shaping and processing</li>\n\t\t<li>Dynamic shaping and processing</li>\n\t\t<li>Achieving the required loudness standard</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Assignment 02: 30%</strong>.

Class discussion will be based on circulated articles and papers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Replication Exercise: Students will be required to work in teams of 2 (choose your team and inform me by 24th October, 2024. You need to select a paper from any of these journals: American Economic Review (AER), the American Economic Journals (AEJ: Applied Economics, Economic Policy), Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE), Journal of Development Economics (JDE), American Journal of Political Science. You can choose papers from other journals too if the datasets are available online. Their websites host data files for recent years and also the computer programs for the results obtained in the papers. Each team will need to select a paper and download the associated files to replicate the main regression models. The &ldquo;do&rdquo; and the &ldquo;log&rdquo; files will be required to be submitted by each team. Two teams cannot work on the same topic (so first come, first served will be the criteria). The teams will under replication analysis/results and present it in a 15-minute presentation at the end of the course in which questions about the paper and how the results were replicated will be answered by the team members.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Marks will not be based on attendance, but past experience shows that it is highly correlated with final grade.</p>\n</div></div>",

It serves as an introduction to modern cryptography, emphasizing its classical goals: data privacy, authenticity, and integrity. It covers the fundamentals of both symmetric-key and public-key cryptography. Additionally, the course introduces advanced cryptography concepts, including commitment schemes, secret sharing, oblivious transfer, zero-knowledge proofs, and multi-party computation.</p>\n\n<p>Privacy and security are central to our emerging &ldquo;information society&rdquo;, and cryptography is a key technology for achieving them; it is also a fascinating field of study in its own right. Cryptography lies at the center of this course, but we will be approaching the subject broadly. On the one end, we&rsquo;ll look at problems of computer and information security and see how cryptographic tools can be used to solve them. We&rsquo;ll also touch on some social issues surrounding the use of cryptography. At the other end, we&rsquo;ll explore the mathematical structures from which cryptographic primitives are built, and learn how to use some of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>Information security, broadly defined, involves controlling the dissemination of information. It includes issues of privacy, data integrity, authenticity, and authority. Because of the ease with which information can be copied and transmitted, traditional physical means of control are of limited efficacy. Cryptography gives a way to build logical controls on the flow of information that are largely independent of the physical properties of the devices used to transmit and store information. In addition to this, while we may rely on cryptography for access control and protection of sensitive data, computer security also includes topics such as physical security, access restrictions, activity monitoring, and control of software defects that go way beyond what will be covered in this course.</p>\n\n<p>Broadly, we will cover:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Symmetric key cryptography: Symmetric Key Encryption, Pseudorandom number generators (PRG), Pseudorandom functions (PRF), Stream ciphers, Block ciphers, Modes of Operations, Security definitions for Encryption, Message integrity, Message authentication codes, Hash Functions.</li>\n\t<li>Public key cryptography: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, Discrete Logarithm Problem. Public key encryption, Security definitions, Factoring Problem, ElGamal&nbsp; Encryption, RSA Encryption. Digital Signatures, RSA Signature, DSA Signature. Introduction to Elliptic Curve, ECDSA Signature. &nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Applications: Public key infrastructure (PKI), Brief Introduction to TLS.</li>\n\t<li>Advanced Cryptography Concepts: Commitment Schemes, Secret Sharing, Oblivious Transfer, Zero knowledge Proofs, Multiparty Computation.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You will have a solid understanding of the mathematical tools for cryptography; symmetric and public key cryptographic techniques as DES, RSA, and zero-knowledge proofs, and their application to problems of maintaining privacy and security in computer networks (such as digital signatures and key management). You will also understand - at a deep, technical level - ideas such as identity, authentication, and verfiability.</p>\n\n<p>You wil also learn to appreciate societal issues as balancing individual privacy concerns against the needs of law enforcement, vulnerability of societal institutions to electronic attack, export regulations and international competitiveness, and development of secure information systems.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>I will provide detailed lecture notes covering everything you need. Any other content/textbooks will be either optional or available for free on the internet.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>40% Homework + 30% Midterm + 30% Final exam</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are expected to attend all lectures.

The objective of this course is to introduce students to the concept of agri-food systems, their role in economic development, why and how they should/could be transformed to be sustainable, resilient, and inclusive in providing livelihoods and nutritious, safe, accessible, affordable, and sufficient food for current and future generations. The course will focus on topics such as global trends in food demand and supply; the roles of organizations, institutions, policy and technology, as well as shocks and crises (such as climate change and COVID-19) on agri-food systems, and will highlight national, regional and global level opportunities and challenges for LMICs to transform their agri-food systems into one that produces sufficient, affordable, accessible, culturally acceptable, safe and nutritious food for all its citizens. In addition to providing the theoretical framework and the latest literature on each topic, each session may also feature an invited guest speaker from the field, and where appropriate will feature to make the topics and working thereon more relatable and accessible to those who may want to work in this field. All these themes will be presented and discussed with an equity and social justice lens. &nbsp;In each class students will have opportunities to present, discuss or debate the topics, and in a few of the classes, experts from the field from within Ashoka or outside will be invited to share their points of view and discuss opportunities and challenges of working in their fields.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There are different sets of readings: a long reading (usually a published journal article), a short reading (a blog, thought piece, policy brief), something to watch (documentary or webinar recording) and something to listen to (podcast or a song). &nbsp;Students are expected to read/watch/listen to these materials before&nbsp;the class and be ready to discuss their contents. I will also provide a wider materials list, after each class, for those interested in digging deeper.</p>\n\n<p>If &ndash; for any class/topic - there is any material (other than those in the syllabus) including academic papers from journals, books, blogs, postings on social media, webinars, news, or any other media that the students find useful, interesting, or important, please share them and be prepared to summarize and highlight why you found the material intriguing for the relevant class/topic</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please try coming to the class having read/watched/listened to the required material, ready to present/discuss if called upon, and with one or two questions you may want to ask in the class including to the guest speaker.&nbsp; You will also be asked to critically assess the assigned material as part of class discussion. Class time will normally be zz&nbsp;hours including a break if 2 classes are ever combined.</p>\n\n<p>The expectation is of the highest standards of intellectual honesty in adhering to full citation of research publications and other materials that you use for your written assignments, according to Ashoka university guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>For written reports, composition style and referencing conventions are flexible but our preference is for author (year) in the text&nbsp;() (of course, with pagination for any quoted material), and cited references listed in complete detail, and in alphabetical (then chronological) ordering at the end in a References section.
